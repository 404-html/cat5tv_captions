home and get back into the everyday

22
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,590
things of life but the good thing about

23
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:24,300
vacation is it gets you out and gets you

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,430
experiencing new things and often we

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,410
take you along with us and I believe you

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,179
have been to California and you have

27
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:35,850
been to Ghana Ghana yeah actually you

28
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:38,190
have been to Ghana and you have been

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,710
with us we went to Tennessee in Kentucky

30
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,200
and we just love taking you along with

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,700
us because so often is the experiences

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,509
of life that speak to our heart that

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,799
teaches about who Jesus is and so on

34
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,079
today's show we're in part three of

35
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,490
signs two weeks ago we talked about the

36
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,780
fact that God actually does want to

37
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,030
speak to you and he often does that's

38
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,770
your the Word of God through script

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,810
britches scripture through prayer

40
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,340
through conversations with people

41
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,250
through circumstances through dreams and

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,380
visions and then last week we talked

43
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,899
about how important discernment was and

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,790
who do you go to in order to help you

45
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,730
discern those signs because sometimes

46
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,160
people can look like believers and say

47
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,650
they're believers but the depth of their

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,170
walk doesn't won't actually prove to be

49
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,260
helpful for discerning what it is that

50
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,930
God is calling you to do and so on

51
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,540
today's show we want to

52
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:39,120
we talked about talked about how

53
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:41,370
sometimes we can receive a sign receive

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,849
a different sign and yet a different

55
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,370
sign and we just will say oh no I don't

56
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,409
like this one no I don't like this one

57
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,420
and we will wait until we get one that

58
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:54,659
we actually like before we then say

59
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:58,730
that's the one that God has for me and

60
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:01,620
I'm thinking specifically how sometimes

61
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,930
when we're seeking discernment we will

62
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,049
go to people and we will keep asking the

63
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,109
same question until we get someone who

64
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:13,109
agrees with what it is that we want and

65
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:15,120
then say that's the believer I'm going

66
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,440
to choose to listen to

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,340
[Music]

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:24,030
yes that's not necessarily a good thing

69
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:26,550
very often when God gives us a sign it

70
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,100
can be uncomfortable like the example

71
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,800
that I gave last week about buying an

72
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,530
outfit and then you know what needing to

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,750
take it back and and the thing is it's a

74
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,790
great outfit and it looks good I could

75
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,550
wear it but I just I knew in my spirit

76
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,410
it is uncomfortable you know to go to

77
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,500
someone and say I think this is what the

78
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,770
Lord is saying and then to actually walk

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,780
it out and we just oh I'll do it I'll do

80
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,760
it next time because it feels

81
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,280
uncomfortable or I could have been

82
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,990
hoping that Jane would have said oh no

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,720
like you're hearing wrong and you know

84
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,880
you have the money go ahead do it and

85
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,560
it's like no like she actually confirmed

86
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,890
what the Spirit was saying and even

87
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,500
though it wasn't an easy thing to do or

88
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,030
that I would want to do it's like no

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,250
this is what the Spirit is saying so I

90
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,600
need to do it and and the reason why

91
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,370
that's so important is because the Bible

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,750
or Jesus Jesus talks about the New

93
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,480
Testament that those who have been

94
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,150
tested and proven right with a little

95
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,760
will actually been given much more and

96
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:36,120
we don't obey God to receive that's not

97
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,690
it but we obey God because we love Him

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,310
and and and sometimes he tests us not to

99
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,220
see what is in our heart because he

100
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,290
already knows what's in our heart and he

101
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:51,600
tests us so we can see what is in our

102
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:54,600
own heart and so you know if God has

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,490
spoken us to through his word or through

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,350
another believer speaking into our life

105
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,870
we can't just brush it off because we

106
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:04,449
don't like it

107
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:06,849
we need to just go okay or

108
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:09,849
how do I response to this and then would

109
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:12,699
you give me the courage right to respond

110
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:16,419
which means that in order for that to

111
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:20,800
happen we have to be in relationship

112
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:24,129
with other believers and so you know

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:29,289
I've heard many say oh I don't need to

114
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:32,919
go to church I can listen to any number

115
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:37,569
of podcasts or you know televangelists

116
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:38,889
on on Netflix or whatever but I don't

117
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:42,009
actually need to be part of a church

118
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:44,139
body and most of the time that's because

119
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,569
we will not allow ourselves to be

120
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:50,050
vulnerable and have other believers

121
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:54,279
speak truth to us so we you know in

122
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:58,960
order for us to be discerning and to and

123
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:01,270
to be able to receive those signs from

124
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,580
God we need to be in relationship with

125
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,800
other believers and we need to be

126
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,169
willing to be vulnerable with those

127
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:14,879
other believers and give them permission

128
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:18,279
to speak truth to us and yeah I've heard

129
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:21,520
things like this and maybe you thought

130
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:23,879
things like this that's just between me

131
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,879
and God

132
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:31,210
right right right yes I believe there

133
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,590
was a country song written that says me

134
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,380
and Jesus we have our own thing going

135
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:39,490
you know it don't matter to anyone else

136
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:43,750
right it's me and Jesus and it's not

137
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:46,120
biblical no and while we do have every

138
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,980
person needs to confess Christ but that

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,350
is the one-on-one relationship with him

140
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,560
and yes it is the Holy Spirit who speaks

141
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:56,770
to us but he does that in community and

142
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,540
right there's so many one anothers in

143
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,340
the inn throughout scripture that's and

144
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,930
one another's means do this to one

145
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,320
another do this to one another do this

146
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,360
like love one another care for one

147
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,820
another show hospitality it's Milic one

148
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,430
another build one another up pray for

149
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,050
each other yes there's so many of those

150
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,800
throw scriptures so and that's really

151
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:22,290
hard to do by yourself and when we talk

152
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,970
about signs it's really hard to discern

153
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:28,870
signs and what God is speaking to us if

154
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,430
you aren't in a fellowship right and so

155
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:35,580
we actually talked about that this week

156
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:39,670
in the context of the four Gospels that

157
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:43,480
each one on its own told a piece of the

158
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:46,660
story but you needed you need all four

159
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,970
Gospels God God put all four Gospels in

160
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,110
the New Testament so that we could get

161
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,940
the perspective from each one of them

162
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,550
because each one on their own remember

163
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,310
different pieces of what had happened

164
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:03,400
and and and Jen and I talked about that

165
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,460
this week in the context of you know

166
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,830
memories and how you know if you grew up

167
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,710
in a family with multiple siblings when

168
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,470
you talk about past events you will all

169
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:17,290
remember it with a different spin or a

170
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,270
different part of it or sometimes one or

171
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,800
more have a memory of it and others

172
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:25,180
don't even remember that particular

173
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,120
event and that's again why you know one

174
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,100
meaning of itself doesn't have the whole

175
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,229
story and and we know this to be true

176
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,430
when we think in the context of

177
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,010
spiritual gifts

178
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,890
yes thus you know the spiritual gifts

179
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,590
are given for the benefit of the whole

180
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,950
body and each one receives a different

181
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:50,930
piece of it so that the whole body can

182
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:53,750
be built up yes and in that way there's

183
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,640
accountability in that so instead of

184
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,340
just someone oh well I think this is

185
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,320
what God is saying and then it's go off

186
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,580
well accountability means I'm gonna talk

187
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,230
to Jane this is what I feel the Lord is

188
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,480
saying to me and she speaks into me and

189
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,250
I get her perspective and and then you

190
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,500
know I go to someone else I I feel this

191
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,880
is what the Lord saves me and and I get

192
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
their perspective and you know I go to

193
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,850
carry and get her some perspective and

194
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,880
then I go to the Lord and say well this

195
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,560
this is what these people are saying how

196
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,020
how do they measure up to what you're

197
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,600
calling me to or they are they you know

198
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,710
sort of I want to say sanding it right

199
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,880
so that I'm sanding it in a sense of

200
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,890
sanding off the rough edges so I'm

201
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,420
hearing clearly and being able to go in

202
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,940
the right way and not that God gives us

203
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,860
a rough message but sometimes he gives

204
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,420
us the message and then as we talk to

205
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,600
other people they bring more clarity to

206
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,850
it oh oh and it starts to I want to say

207
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,860
resound and your spirit like and it

208
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,380
might not even be its most times it's

209
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,470
not easy actually it's actually quite

210
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:54,530
difficult right knowing that other

211
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:57,380
people who love Jesus have spoken into

212
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:01,040
your life now and it's confirming that

213
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,420
then it's like okay that wasn't it's not

214
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,160
going to be easy but I do believe this

215
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,790
what God is

216
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,230
- so we're gonna pause now I want you to

217
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,290
think about that for a minute like who

218
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,389
how are you doing with networking with

219
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,930
other leaders and we will be back right

220

251
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:53,950
in I want to say the closing stretch of

252
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,760
our series on signs and and just it has

253
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,860
been so interesting for the last week

254
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,780
basically I want to say reading the

255
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,670
signs whether it is through

256
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,430
conversations with people or literally

257
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,740
reading the signs or are listening to

258
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,600
our GPS speak to us and trying to

259
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,830
discern ok this isn't the map of saying

260
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,410
but this is what she's saying and

261
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,260
actually a couple times she has led us

262
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,120
down the wrong way yes and twice to be

263
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,470
exact we were looking for a Starbucks

264
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,270
and we got to this place and Jane said

265
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,510
I think one of these houses is Starbucks

266
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,340
and I and we're both laughing cuz it's

267
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,950
like we both know that's not true but

268
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,320
the GP has obviously thought that one of

269
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,450
the his houses with Starbucks and then

270
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,890
we tried to go to this place called

271
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:40,920
Pillsbury Crossing you tried twice and

272
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,360
both times like the first time she did

273
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,210
not lead is to fill the Pillsbury

274
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,280
crossing it was really cool a cool place

275
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,130
to be one for a cool walk but that was

276
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,350
not where we were supposed to be so that

277
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,790
goes along with like sometimes you think

278
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,430
you're going in the right direction and

279
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,550
and she was a trusted person like we

280
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:01,530
were trusting her that she would know

281
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,780
what it is that we should be doing but

282
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,490
she didn't but she thought she didn't

283
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,610
right but here's the thing

284
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,190
cuz here's the interesting thing is that

285
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,260
we made this observation about her her

286
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,540
sorry you need to know her name is Sarah

287
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,400
we've just dumped her Sarah because you

288
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,420
know you you've got to give your GPS a

289
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,350
name

290
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:25,470
Sarah has not been updated so Sarah's

291
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,160
satellite information is more than a

292
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,940
year old

293
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,760
yeah eenz that sarah doesn't have the

294
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,820
most current information no she does not

295
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:41,220
really you know when when we think about

296
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:43,230
our life as a Jesus follower the only

297
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,550
way for us to have the most current

298
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,210
information is to be regularly in God's

299
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,910
Word

300
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:58,100
yes and so that's really you know where

301
00:13:52,910 --> 00:14:02,460
we wanted to land with you was just you

302
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:05,700
cannot speak the word if you don't know

303
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:09,590
the word yeah and we heard that this

304
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:13,380
morning in church and we heard it at

305
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,690
Jeremy camp spoke that as well just the

306
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,149
importance

307
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:20,029
of being regularly in God's words so

308
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:25,129
that we will be able to use that as a

309
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:27,980
sort to to sustain us to keep the enemy

310
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:30,079
at bay but we can only do that if we're

311
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,540
current and if we don't know it and if

312
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,689
we aren't reading God's Word then we

313
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,490
will be of little use when it comes to

314
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:40,069
hardship because that is the number one

315
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,350
place that God chooses to speak to us is

316
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:44,089
through his word or else we're gonna end

317
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,509
up at these dead ends order perceived

318
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:50,449
dead things in our life based on why I

319
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:52,610
read through the Bible once okay but the

320
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:54,259
Word of God says it's living and active

321
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,730
it's sharper than any double-edged sword

322
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:57,949
so it's not just about reading it once

323
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:01,399
and thinking you you know it all it is

324
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:03,500
about keeping contact keeping in contact

325
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,600
with it and and the pastor that spoke

326
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,279
this morning he's like well you might

327
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,540
not be pulling out your sword but are

328
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,720
you pulling out your phone with the app

329
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,699
like are you actually touching the app

330
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,550
itself and reading it taking it in and

331
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:19,519
he said you know what we give the first

332
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,980
10% of our money to the Lord we give the

333
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,100
first day of our week to the Lord we

334
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,089
give the first day for firstfruits

335
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,160
firstfruits

336
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:30,470
to the Lord Lord the first of our year

337
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,449
to the Lord in fasting and so he's like

338
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,269
we need to give the first of our day to

339
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,069
do the Lord so that we can actually you

340
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,800
know receive from the Lord what he has

341
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:42,529
for us and so then we can then walk

342
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,620
forward in what we've read because that

343
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:47,329
is the first and strongest place that he

344
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,620
is going to speak to us and you can say

345
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,740
but Jen you mentioned all those other

346
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,240
things and I said I did he does speak to

347
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,630
us through dreams and through prayer but

348
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:00,620
the main spot he speaks to us is through

349
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:03,530
is word and it says that Jesus is the

350
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,120
word right the word became flesh and

351
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:08,090
lived among us and the where we learn

352
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,890
about Jesus is in the Word of God so

353
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,810
that's why it's so important that you

354
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,550
get in your word every day and the thing

355
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,980
is and we learned about this to the

356
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,780
enemy we believe that we are in a

357
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,420
spiritual battle and that Satan does not

358
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,070
want us reading the Word of God because

359
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,050
if we get to know God if we get to know

360
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,820
Jesus if we get to know the plans and

361
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,100
purposes that he has for our life which

362
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,960
is where we originally started off then

363
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,730
we're gonna walk in freedom we're gonna

364
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,440
walk in abundance we're gonna walk in

365
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,270
grace we're gonna walk in like we're

366
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,930
gonna be mighty people of God and he

367
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,450
doesn't want that

368
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,790
so he's gonna try to discourage you he's

369
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,680
gonna try to you know have you up late

370
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,330
at night so you're tired in the morning

371
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,440
so you're like I'll read it when I come

372
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,530
home well then he's gonna have you

373
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,930
volunteered at something important and

374
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,250
oh you're gonna come home really late or

375
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,190
too tired read I'll do it tomorrow

376
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,740
morning but you wake up tomorrow and the

377
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,020
cycle just begins or you know all of a

378
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,700
sudden you're here somebody calls and

379
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,320
needs to have that conversation with you

380
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,689
and it's all of a sudden you can go a

381
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,329
week and you haven't actually read the

382
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,880
Word of God and and it's not because you

383
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,310
haven't been doing good things

384
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,680
but because you've allowed good things

385
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,329
to actually creep in so you're not

386
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,199
attending to some of the better things

387
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:22,390
which is spending time with God so we

388
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,959
want to encourage you to spend time with

389
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:29,350
the Lord in his word every day and not

390
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,000
just reading it but hiding it hiding it

391
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,890
in your heart and that was one of the

392
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,220
things that the pastor said this morning

393
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:38,050
was you need to hide God's Word in your

394
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,300
heart it's not just about reading God's

395
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:43,630
Word you need to hide it so that when

396
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,640
something comes up what comes out of you

397
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,090
is the Word of God because that's what

398
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,730
Jesus did when he had been tested in the

399
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,310
wilderness and Satan came after him then

400
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,410
with everything that Satan attacked him

401
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,390
with he came with the Word of God like

402
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,190
it is written it is written it is

403
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,810
written it is written and so it's so

404
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,760
important that when you're struggling

405
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,380
with something you can say no it is

406
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,660
written greater is He that is in me than

407
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,920
he that incident in the world no I can

408
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,680
do all things through Christ who

409
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,150
strengthens me because it is written no

410
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,860
because it is written I don't have to be

411
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,630
anxious about anything but can you know

412
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,370
and it just goes on it is written

413
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,640
because as soon as you claim the Word of

414
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,470
God then you're walking you're walking

415
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,690
in the things God has for you and you're

416
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,700
going to be able to discern what the

417
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,110
signs are and what God is saying to you

418
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,510
so many people are like well what does

419
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,160
God want me to do it's in the word so

420
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,990
unless you read the Word of God you're

421
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,860
not going to know half of what God wants

422
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:42,010
you to do or even how to do it so we

423

encourage you get your Bible out if you

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,730
so fortunate in our culture to have so

440
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:25,440
many different resources at our

441
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:29,520
fingertips which we take for granted I

442
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:33,390
take for granted just how easy and how

443
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:36,840
accessible it is but I don't ever want

444
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:40,169
to take for granted the weight of the

445
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,230
Word of God and how it is that it can

446
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:48,140
change my life and continue to change my

447
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:53,880
life and knit me closer to my Jesus that

448
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:57,419
died for me so we're ending off the

449
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,429
series on signs the major sign is God

450

454
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:11,970
