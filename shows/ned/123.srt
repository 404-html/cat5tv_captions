Philip who was chosen after Jesus Christ

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,390
had been resurrected yeah and ascended

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,670
into heaven and he was chosen as well as

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,800
Stephen to be a minister to the poor so

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,739
that the Apostles could be freed up to

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,750
then teach and preach yes right yes so

18
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:04,030
where we at now where we at now we are

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:06,970
in Acts chapter 8 verse 9 and here we go

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,340
okay now for some time a man named Simon

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,040
had practiced sorcery in the city and a

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,380
mace or in the city of a Samaria and all

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,660
the people of sand and amazed all the

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,630
people of Samaria he boasted that he was

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,160
someone great and all the people both

26
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,110
high and low gave him their attention

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,479
and exclaimed this man is the divine

28
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,399
power known as the great power they

29
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,860
followed him because he had amazed them

30
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:32,050
for a long time with his magic but when

31
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,910
they believed Philip as he preached the

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,860
good news of the kingdom of God and the

33
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,810
name of Jesus Christ they were baptized

34
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,120
both men and women Simon himself

35
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,400
believed and was baptized and he

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,190
followed Philip everywhere astonished by

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,600
the great signs and miracles he saw when

38
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,030
the Apostles in Jerusalem heard that

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,640
Samaria had accepted the Word of God

40
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,010
they sent John or Peter and John to them

41
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,260
when they arrived they prayed for them

42
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,060
that they might receive the Holy Spirit

43
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,310
because the Holy Spirit had not yet come

44
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,189
upon them they had simply been baptized

45
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,110
into the name of the Lord Jesus then

46
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,869
Peter and John placed their hands on

47
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,760
them and they received the Holy Spirit

48
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,230
when Simon saw that the Spirit had was

49
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,390
given at the laying on of the Apostles

50
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,700
hands he offered them money and said

51
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,890
give me also this ability so that

52
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,709
everyone on whom I lay my hands may

53
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,380
receive the Holy Spirit Peter answered

54
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,989
may your money perish with you because

55
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,600
you thought you could buy the gift of

56
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:30,070
God with money you have no part or share

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,019
in this ministry because your heart is

58
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,549
not right before God repent of this

59
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,680
wickedness and pray to the Lord perhaps

60
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,840
he will forgive you for having such a

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,489
thought in your heart for I see that you

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,650
are full of bitterness and captive to

63
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,180
sin then Simon answered pray to the Lord

64
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,310
for me so that nothing you have said may

65
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,690
happen to

66
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,370
when they had testified and proclaimed

67
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,710
the word of the Lord Peter and John to

68
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:56,590
Jerusalem preaching the gospel and many

69
00:02:50,710 --> 00:03:00,550
Samaritan villages hmm yes you know last

70
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:03,459
week we talked about how when Philip

71
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:06,130
went to Samaria he preached the word and

72
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:09,070
then also did many miraculous signs and

73
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,230
people were drawn to the Lord in part

74
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,730
because of the miraculous signs that God

75
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,660
was doing something through Philip that

76
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,410
they had never seen or encountered

77
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,209
before

78
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:21,130
I know and here's Simon the sorcerer yes

79
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:23,170
it sounds like a bad guy from a Disney

80
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:27,880
movie right here I know hi I'm Simon the

81
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:31,720
sorcerer anyways um he kind of takes it

82
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,590
totally out of context he is seeing the

83
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,470
miracle

84
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,660
without realizing the the cause of the

85
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,020
miraculous who is the person of Jesus

86
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:44,980
Christ yeah Ruth Philip so it's like

87
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:47,230
he's he's worshiping the actual miracles

88
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,870
themselves and not encountering the God

89
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,530
behind them well I think you know as I

90
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,920
read this it says that he believed he

91
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,480
himself believed and was baptized and he

92
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,269
followed and listened to this and he

93
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,260
followed Philip everywhere astonished by

94
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:07,660
the great signs and miracles he saw so

95
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,170
you're right he was totally captivated

96
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,540
by the power of the Holy Spirit moving

97
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,060
through Philip and he was more

98
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,940
captivated by what Philip was doing then

99
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:23,520
through the power behind it which was

100
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:27,400
the Holy Spirit yeah and and so when

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,450
Peter and John are sent from Jerusalem

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,669
to check this out that you know they lay

103
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:37,660
hands on and they received the Holy

104
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:40,479
Spirit and Simon sees this and he's like

105
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,600
whoa I want that too this could be

106
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,130
moneymaker he didn't want the Spirit he

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:52,060
didn't want Spirit he wanted the power

108
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:55,210
he wanted the power ha ha I just feel

109
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:01,810
such a huge gut check right now because

110
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:05,770
I have met people who move in the power

111
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,979
of God and there they're almost

112
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,990
worshipped for what they can do and

113
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:14,139
literally if you go here this man he'll

114
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,840
prophesy over you and I'm like and now

115
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,539
I'm sitting here and I still I felt I

116
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:25,380
feel the same way as I did then like am

117
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:27,610
I going to hear this man or am I going

118
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,660
because I want to hear what God has to

119
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,759
say and there's such a fine line there

120
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,120
am I going to worship this man and him

121
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,830
it he can do what he can say or am I

122
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,009
going to meet with God say what do you

123
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,440
have for me like there's such because we

124
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,270
worship we worship our pastors we

125
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,060
worship worship leaders we worship

126
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,560
people with the gifts of prophecy and we

127
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,419
just did you hear what this person said

128
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,340
did you hear and it's like yes I'm

129
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,620
saying did you hear what God said

130
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:00,340
through that person yeah right

131
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,470
oh no we would say they are so like wow

132
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,000
the power of God like they just moves

133
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,210
through them and we almost worship them

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,009
I think I want to be like them yeah but

135
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,880
I I think that one of the signs of a

136
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,949
false teacher is that they don't

137
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,440
redirect the accolades to the Lord and

138
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,039
like give the credit where the credit is

139
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,639
due

140
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,830
but the humility that some teachers and

141
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,530
preachers embody is reflective of the

142
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,110
character of Christ and so that's a more

143
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,330
clear sign that you know what they're

144
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,940
doing is through God and they point you

145
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:37,630
in that direction so the miracles the

146
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:40,270
healing the wisdom and the teaching that

147
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,250
they provide then turn people down a

148
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,710
path to knowing Christ for the first

149
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,360
time or knowing him more intimately and

150
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,070
I think like Philip was there

151
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,380
Philip was all over like as he was

152
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,969
preaching the gospel and there were

153
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,949
signs and wonders that accompanied him

154
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:55,900
because he was right with Jesus right

155
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,820
yeah so people came to know him because

156
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,610
of what he was speaking and and the

157
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:04,029
signs and wonders so Philip isn't the

158
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,310
problem it's Simon who sees that instead

159
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:08,860
of seeing Jesus he sees the power he

160
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,159
sees the the wonders he and he

161
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,889
misses out on the who the who is doing

162
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:17,680
this part and it's like I want to

163
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:19,210
believe so I can do those powers I can

164
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,069
have those powers now I want to believe

165
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,770
because I want to be close to Jesus so

166
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,300
yeah you want to think about that I want

00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,860
gen yes I know we're gonna just dive

194
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,680
right back in we're still talking about

195
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,659
Philip and the gen where did we leave

196
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,180
off there well we left off with Simon

197
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,190
the sorcerer and asking the question do

198
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,060
we worship the messenger or do we

199
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:56,920
worship the message okay yes I knew I

200
00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:01,779
was gonna say Simon the sorcerer himself

201
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:08,079
believed and was baptized yes what I

202
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:10,149
appreciate about that is that the Philip

203
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:14,019
and the other people who were preaching

204
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:16,449
and teaching they didn't like have them

205
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:19,060
fill out a survey they didn't you know

206
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:21,649
there was no vetting process if they

207
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,720
said they believed they believed

208
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,749
they baptize them and it was the Holy

209
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,369
Spirit and God who brought who sifted

210
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:30,379
through what his true motives of the

211
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:32,059
heart we're right and proverbs does say

212
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:34,490
that the Lord looks at the motives of

213
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:36,499
the heart and identifies that and then

214
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,360
when Peter and it was a John who came

215
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:40,689
down mm-hm

216
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,980
then they were able to say to Simon like

217
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:44,809
you're not in this for the right thing

218
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,819
you're you may your money perish with

219
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:49,910
you that's this is not what this is

220
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:51,800
about and I really see that gen as the

221
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,480
mercy and grace of God because it

222
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,269
doesn't we don't hear about what happens

223
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,499
to Simon after he's just like oh pray

224
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:58,910
the Lord for me that none of the things

225
00:09:57,499 --> 00:10:00,709
which you have spoken may come upon me

226
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,119
you know what I find interesting about

227
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:04,490
that passage right there though is he

228
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:07,309
doesn't repent no he doesn't repent but

229
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,879
that is the opportunity to repent and we

230
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:14,149
don't know if he does or not it you're

231
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,589
right and I'm just saying that's if if

232
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,139
someone's in the wrong and he studies

233
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:19,730
believed then it's an opportunity for

234
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,089
the church the community believers to

235
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,709
say hey wait a sec this isn't lining up

236
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,470
with what you said you believed and it's

237
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,939
an opportunity from God in His mercy

238
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,920
that he has the opportunity now to

239
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:34,490
repent you know yes I hear what you're

240
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,920
saying

241
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:41,269
I hear what you're saying but I feel

242
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,120
like if he had repented they would have

243
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:46,459
written it in and maybe maybe the prayer

244
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,019
where it says pray to the Lord for me so

245
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:49,910
it's not like basically saying oh no

246
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,709
that those things won't happen to me I

247
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:56,779
don't want the consequences but it

248
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:58,550
doesn't actually say wow I was wrong and

249
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:01,610
you're right this is where the body of

250
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,889
Christ comes alongside to say okay let's

251
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,660
just because you did believe and you

252
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:08,389
were baptized you're baptized in the

253
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,819
name of Jesus okay some of your motives

254
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:13,639
are on here yeah so let's just talk

255
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:15,499
through that and and that's part of your

256
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,290
right I don't think they I don't think

257
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:20,389
they wrote him off that does not it

258
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,069
doesn't the passage didn't give it give

259
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:26,089
that inclination that they wrote him off

260
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:28,879
yeah but it does give the idea of your

261
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:32,470
right maybe there is room for more

262
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:34,170
teaching and mentoring to come alongside

263
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,959
Simon to

264
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,480
say okay daddy yeah let's talk about

265
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,440
this let's talk about who the Holy

266
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,800
Spirit is let's talk about Jesus my

267
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,529
guess is that Simon was a Samaritan so

268
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:55,560
there was an understanding of the gosta

269
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:58,529
becoming Messiah not quite the same as

270
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,260
the Jews who had a deep understanding of

271
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:03,389
the coming Messiah but going back to the

272
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,639
Samaritan woman it says well no you Jews

273
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,190
preach that you know and so there's an

274
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:12,329
idea that they understand somewhat of

275
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:14,990
the Jewish faith but here's your right

276
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:19,250
an opportunity to come alongside and

277
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:21,360
mentor him and what's cool is there are

278
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,089
people in our church who will just come

279
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,620
alongside other people and and track

280
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,839
with them for a while and mentor them

281
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,380
and speak truth into their life mm-hmm

282
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,300
and and so maybe this is you know one of

283
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,029
those chapters that sort of brings that

284
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,240
to the forefront like wow it's so easy

285
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,399
to write Simon off hmm but we need

286
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,500
someone to come alongside Simon right

287
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,240
and and that's what the fact that he

288
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,760
believed and was baptized was like okay

289
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,610
you're in the posse now like you're in

290
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,880
the club yeah and and sometimes in

291
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,910
churches there are people who well you

292
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,390
said you believed but mm tell me right

293
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:03,630
here right here and I think it just

294
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:05,490
shows to go ya that that those kind of

295
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,320
people who have that skewed

296
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,899
understanding do exist within the church

297
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,970
but if the church is healthy and has

298
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,070
people like the Peters and the John's

299
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,199
and the Phillips yes who can readily

300
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,600
identify if people aren't actually

301
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:20,160
following what the Bible says and it

302
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,540
becomes a more healthy church body

303
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,000
because they're given the opportunity to

304
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,490
repent and change their ways and God in

305
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,920
His mercy I know I've seen this happen

306
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,779
in the church Jen people were kind of

307
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,889
like going astray and like doing things

308
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:35,160
that were going to be harmful and

309
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:38,010
someone very lovingly came and said this

310
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,709
is not God's best for you God loves you

311
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,410
this is not what he this is not what he

312
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:46,110
intends this is wrong and that is what

313
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,000
Peter and John do like they're just they

314
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,400
speak directly to the truth

315
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,510
and and they don't mince words yeah I

316
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:57,750
think it's true

317
00:13:51,510 --> 00:14:00,030
they're very clear and it is a challenge

318
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,480
you're right how do you speak the truth

319
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:06,360
and then come alongside yeah now like

320
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,190
Peter and and John and Philip were

321
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,200
evangelists and apostles at this point

322
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,780
so their job was not to come alongside

323
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,630
and walk with people we don't see that

324
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:18,690
at all often Peters going off on his own

325
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:22,500
and doing whatever but that's where like

326
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:24,600
the Barnabas comes in the Silas comes in

327
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,520
people in your life who come in

328
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,200
alongside you and say let's let's do

329
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,600
some life together and I know very often

330
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,370
that's what Carrie and I do like okay

331
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,440
you're doing this have you thought about

332
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,060
this or or I'm doing this what are your

333
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,850
thoughts about this and just like iron

334
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,500
sharpening iron and being the okay I'm

335
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,700
gonna speak some truth into your life

336
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:47,460
right and and just like that mentor or

337
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,810
help that we often need in our Christian

338
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,100
life to help straighten out some of the

339
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,650
things that we think are some of the

340
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,960
behaviors often will confess to each

341
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,850
other going I was thinking that I was

342
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,530
doing this and it is wrong and then we

343
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,540
you know we take that as an opportunity

344
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,900
just to come alongside and encourage and

345
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:07,230
and so that might be where you're at

346
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,490
right now maybe maybe you're a Simon and

347
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,400
you've been looking at the messenger

348
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:15,480
instead of the message or maybe you're a

349
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,520
Peter and James are a Peter and John who

350
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,290
actually you see something and you know

351
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,980
it's wrong maybe you need to speak truth

352
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,380
into that life or maybe you're a

353
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,020

354
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:32,280

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:34,410

356
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,660
