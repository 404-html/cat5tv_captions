today we are gonna learn how to make
your spray of your choice do this with a
bunch of custom blocks by the way only
some of them aren't useful so hello
today we're gonna learn how to make some
pretty cool custom blocks and scratch
this is episode three
[Music]
okay so we're just gonna work with this
scratch pad first thing today we're
gonna make a block where he says
something so you're gonna take say gonna
touch more blocks make a block and you
can't I let say
and
number
you can add more inputs if you want but
for now we'll just be working for it
with that so make a variable call it
whatever you want for this right below
me put that set clout count to zero make
this for that spread on me do the same
thing but instead of zero make it
nothing
then repeat lengths of say okay but it's
gonna what stretch that is gonna say now
first off to wait delay to seconds
say
better count
join
count by one set letters to join letters
letter count of say wait dudes 1 seconds
that's just right
hello welcome to stuff that works if
let's just make this simple if eat if
letter count of say equals but and as
many as you want doesn't really matter
you don't even need this part but it
makes it look better
equals dot or that that's afforded this
rate
times 3 la 1 times 3
place sound sound that is really loud
seems pretty good say say for delay to
sex
that looks pretty wrong
see enter text here and then why does
this happen it deletes the other things
and in a minute I can type in whatever
also if letter account of say equals
space if not
place sounds
No
also you can mess around with this as
much as you want
and you can get different cells such as
you can make it look like he's typing it
by doing this join then now it'll kind
of looks like he's typing it which is
pretty cool and I'll show you ten random
sounds such as let's just take away if
you want a shorter way you can just
write - I think I would suggest to just
write the number in here it works it's a
lot easier
here's another one that could be pretty
useful next costume speed then options
speed that works
then reap Pete
this one repeat this computer is not
acting good it's being to me is being
very mean this will change the costume
by a certain speed so repeat
repeat / speed switch costume - costume
number + speed that's pretty simple I'm
just going to make a bunch of random
costumes
then speed to speed3
speed one repeat night let's see if this
works
yep that works I've never actually tried
this I just thought of it
repeat 18
that's pretty cool you have to admit
also this one's this is a block that
will be used very often with costs due
to loss to number minus 1
I don't know how to spell previously
this is really simple switch to costume
it's basically the same as this but
instead it's minus 1
repeat nine switch class I'm going to
eat most of these cuz it's just nonsense
yeah that works
costume on
this will be good for like smooth
jumping and stuff so first you're going
to need a variable Y and a variable X
for this bright only set X
when two wives are sat next to art x-bar
oh yeah forgot you need edit three-peat
I always use this change Y by change X
by
change X change Y square for her - okay
and I'll show you what that does
except I live our 210 change Y bar by
minus 1 set X far to five change X bar
by minus 0.5 repeat 21 now smoothly a
jump or move you can do couldn't change
it up as much as you want
their new block if answer equal equals
then sit then sit next to
[Applause]
yes
if
it is answer equals answer text
they're also asked
Oh morning say 0.0 25 0
and then ask ask so now how tightly oh
sorry
if answer equals
man if answer equals okay okay oh that
needs to be a different type of thing
all right whoops oh and I did it again
edit
set text to
all right and
okay
that is really the way oh don't worry
okay then say text
0.05 one two
no no no no no no okay
right
play sound number sound number
and wait one second we're just gonna put
this like that because then you get this
weird block play sound sound number wait
that six okay
place our number throat to
this is just something that you can do
we need ten sounds now okay that's all
we have time for right now so hope you
learned something today
[Laughter]
