hello today you want to learn how to
make this thing and scratch make a
platformer just watch this video okay
watch it
[Music]
hello this is Mortimer today I'm going
to show you how to make a basic
platformer on scratch so what you're
going to do is you're going to click
create
you need a Adobe Flash Player in order
for this to work unfortunately and this
brings up this weird orange cat thing
get out here
bye bye so which makes up this is gonna
be the character sprite zoom in press
convert to vector over here bottom left
go here make sure it's like this and put
your mouse about right here and then
that'll be like the character's head now
what you're gonna do in order to make
the feet you're gonna grab line make
sure it's a bit smaller than the head so
like that then we're gonna make idle
animation so I'd show you just standing
I think so then what you're going to do
is you're going to click duplicate and
you're gonna click here press backspace
then you're gonna take this this will be
the run animation so like this and then
you're gonna duplicate that but this
song do not delete it no wait
yeah don't delete it just take this
flied it a bit with this circle then
there here's the running animation if
you want to make it even better than go
ahead and delete these and just take
this again put in the middle you make it
looked like it's just one foot and then
so that's your character I would suggest
to take the fill and take a white fill
all of the sprites heads
but if his head isn't transparent if you
want you can name them but I wouldn't
suggest make it complicated so you grab
the one flake clicked from event then
you're gonna drag your guy over to where
you want him to start point in Direction
90 and go to X and then it'll do like
where he is
like so then
this is how I make play I just go to
more blocks make a block play cuz I feel
like it just so that you can have a
restart thing okay so in order for your
guy to move you have to grab move ten
steps
well first you grab if if if free those
then go tear no not there
if P up arrow which will be jump if key
right arrow which will be right
obviously then left arrow which is left
you're gonna go to motion you're going
to click this i'd suggest for um
negative numbers is so that it goes left
so minus 4p up arrow pressed change Y by
10 like negative numbers is down yeah so
I would suggest to take forever now
let's test it
that's funny
then in order to make him actually jump
you do
if
wait you do oh you have to make the
stage so click this the fort first level
is just going to be simple with this
you have to take this and go to x0 y0
okay now you take your character oh that
that's black I'm gonna make that
difference that you can see a seat
Phil
there
and
this will be at the back so go to looks
go back since it's at the very back dude
99 so you're not gonna have 99 sprites
that would be insane okay so here is the
idol so P right arrow you're gonna do
switch costumes costume costumes too
and same for the left arrow then you're
gonna do since there are three thingies
like three character sprites
I'm just gonna make a block which is run
now put run right here and then for run
what you're gonna do is next costume
since it's costume
- and there's four costumes you'll do a
repeat - also switch costume it'll cost
you - then you're gonna do what you have
to do now is wait 0.07 this like like so
you'll go to looks switch cost you to
costume 3 then costume - yeah like that
and wait 0.07
let's see how that works pretty good
looks like he's walking now to make him
move more smooth
you're gonna put and move I would
suggest about two to two three would be
good
and move to
the bad thing about this is you
continues moving and it's like that now
instead of having run here you're gonna
go to backpack I have a lot of stuff in
here just click on the arrow right here
or you could just press duplicate then
you'll make a new block run left then
you're gonna do move - two - two
and - - and let's see
so that's right that's left we'll have
to fix that
what
but
that's weird
how'd that happen
let's see
but don't make any sense lalalalalalala
oh I know you have to put run left in I
forgot now it should work now for this
you would put it in a different one so
then put it in forever
[Applause]
not
now if
yeah if not touching sprite to which is
the ground and then you put another one
oh wait no you don't you put and oh my
gosh put and put in there.put P up arrow
change Y by - what oh we need another
not not touching spray to change Y by
let's say - five
let's try that
nope
Oh take
and else if and else then
change Y by minus five change that to 5
and then put repeat until touching sprit
2
the moving thing is not going very fast
so change it to a bigger number minus
five let's change it to three point five
- 3.5
3.5
now let's see if that's too fast or too
slow that's pretty good
okay
better idea do one this clicked
forever if it's sensing key right arrow
pressed P left arrow press let's try
that see if it works better kind of but
not really
wait 0.1 seconds
the jump needs to be fixed
Inc of it no not that go to looks or
emotion
data just go down and make a variable
wait
that's definitely how you spell it
press this checkbox so that doesn't show
on game do this set off to zero
change it by one if height equals 15
then
repeat until touching
sprite to
change Y by minus five let's try it
there's the jump nope it doesn't work
oh I know
you have to put set height that
obviously says height to zero at the
start so that does it lets it doesn't
let you jump any higher than that
I would suggest to change it to 25
the walking animation is not working
very well
I know
no I don't never mind
we'll just keep that don't need to look
perfect after all there will probably be
a part two on this touching no yeah
straight to costumes you need to put
what will the end block be was to say
this color put that up where you want
this player to win do instead of
touching sprite to
instead of touchings for it to to touch
in color and then this make sure it's
always the same color that they make
sure the ground is always the same color
so now what we're going to do is make
this thing fo the purple make you go to
the next level let's just say
this
it's the next level
so when
let's do
forever a forever block wait until
touching color and highlight that car
and then I would suggest to make a sound
so that you know that you got to the
next level and then and here there's oh
yeah you would since this is not the
background you will broadcast message
one then when I receive message one next
costume and at the start switch costume
costume one now if you touch that it
will wait Oh
he has to go to the start so do go to X
- like just where he was before
I'm not actually sure how to fix this oh
well it's fine now we're gonna make an
obstacle so that is going to be
you can either make an obstacle or
literally just delete the block so let's
say boom
when this clicked forever
take an ore block
touching color oh we haven't made the
obstacle yet so the moment was just too
touching edge glide one seconds to that
so let's try it there's also an edge
right here it's good though because then
the player can't cheat by wall jumping
on the edge there will also be a wall
jumps a roof in order to fix this in
order to make them stand on here do this
this is my way of doing it forever
touching color this thing
go to
no change Y by 10 unfortunately this
happens change Y by 1 this 2 stews 0.1
now you shouldn't sink into the ground
out maybe so
oh I know what we can do that can just
be a feature we could like make there be
red will be the obstacle so red right
here
now since we have read which is also an
obstacle
if touching color this thing then if you
touch that either than you will also
have to restart
the run is not working out very well
oh well
we'll fix it in the next tutorial Dada
Dada Dada Dada had it up yeah I win for
the first level I would suggest to like
write something I'm just gonna write the
title of the game lat
for Danny that's the title and make it
big
genin that's the red color so if you
touch it you're dead Dan not that you
can oh you can not run
fix that
okay let's make another thing which is
black and then we'll do if touching
black change X by whatever change X by
maybe M minus 1 at r1
oh I know wait yeah I don't know
nevermind so run
I stuck up my own game this black thing
does nothing
I'll just fill it with
read so that it kills you
right
platform sing is the title of my awesome
game to make it cool you can add bad
guys but I'm just gonna make like one or
two more levels let duplicate duplicate
duplicate just delete delete okay so for
a bad guy you would I'm just gonna pick
us brakes I really don't want to make
one right now what is something that is
evil a princess of course nope
yeah things apples are evil oh well this
guy
that's the bad guy
yeah
duplicate
so
when flag clicked hide switch costume -
evil Singh aka singer one
right here when you win a level stage
you can keep that on okay set stage to
zero when you start change
staged by one then
forever
and grab an equals from operators stage
equals three then
well first of all you need to see it so
you know
show obviously go to this place
move
- turn
phone edge bounce
and repeat until
touching
it's great one with just you
then you're gonna oh and next costume
just to make it look cool 0.05 is this
too much okay platform thingy let's see
if it's way too much dad
Stage two I need to set stage two one
when you stay because you do start at
stage one you don't start at stage zero
oh my gosh
I'm gonna keep that that looks cool
sound I'm just gonna add a weird sound
hmm there's no sound something there
okay mr. perfect that'll be
that'll be the music I guess I need to
edit that otherwise that just sounds
weird
maybe if I delete some of that I have
this sound in here so I'm just gonna use
this goof I think a lot of you know what
that is
play sound
ah doubt Oh is she in every single stage
repeat until
stage equals stage
equals
why isn't the jump line
I don't think it works that well
so just stop the jump normal thing oh my
gosh
I'm gonna change this song that's just
not very good
perfect
unfortunately that's all we have time
for today
so if you want me to all make up part to
try please like and comment that's the
game
unfortunately bye bye
wait I need to name it perfect
my stuff
if you go to my stuff then you'll see it
right here goodbye I guess
