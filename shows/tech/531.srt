stuff on there that we might want to

looking at those wireless earbuds but

69
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,310
we're going to take it to the next level

70
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,860
with something that is perhaps the best

71
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,080
wireless earbuds that I have ever had

72
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,250
the opportunity to play with where we

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
doing that in just a couple mists I'm so

74
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,700
what's new sash what's new with me um

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,420
Dave Star playing on this computer and

76
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,040
loves it yeah what else is new in my

77
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,010
life I feel like that's it

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,610
like that's it you've got a gaming rig

79
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:24,370
at home so that's all you can do now I

80
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,400
did receive my marriage certificate in

81
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,680
the mail

82
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,659
it actually happened Dave legit they

83
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,879
took a little while to get here it did

84
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,409
there was I you don't marry counting on

85
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,329
the other side of the country exactly

86
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:40,900
they had to mail it they had to be at

87
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,670
the post and the first time I requested

88
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,980
well the first time I requested it they

89
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,260
couldn't find the paperwork Oh

90
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,459
so actually that's not something that

91
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,980
you want them to say on the other end of

92
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,480
the phone requested it twice because of

93
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,859
that because they couldn't find it the

94
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,900
first time but then I guess they must

95
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,849
have found it from the first request so

96
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,519
I actually have to well your story about

97
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:05,720
marriage certificates yeah what Becca

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:09,170
and I got married in 2001 and her maid

99
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,269
of honor was her sister Rachel and we we

100
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,920
had the ceremony everything went perfect

101
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:14,359
the weather was a little bit rainy but

102
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,650
good enough that we got our photos done

103
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,840
outdoors and it was it was nice

104
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,760
everything turned out perfectly and then

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,979
we got our marriage license and guess

106
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,880
what what I apparently married her

107
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:31,330
sister Rachel all done in fancy

108
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:35,000
calligraphy Rob Ferguson married Rachel

109
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,639
so what wait now so then how did they

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,520
fix that well I think the certificate is

111
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,229
just kind of like the the final legal

112
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,919
document it was an error on the

113
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:47,659
calligraphers part I don't know how it

114
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,550
happened to be honest but our marriage

115
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:51,550
license actually has whiteout on it

116
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,860
actually slightly worse not to one-up in

117
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,930
that in in the spot where everybody is

118
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:11,150
supposed to be signing yeah in the

119
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:14,000
moment the mayor I love her but it was

120
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,909
her very last before retirement ceremony

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,530
oh yeah okay so she was pointing out

122
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:20,090
where we needed to sign and do things

123
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,770
and she said right Newfoundland here in

124
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,659
Labrador here because the province is

125
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,800
called Newfoundland and Labrador so I

126
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,240
used to confuse things

127
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,599
I married LaBrie you don't name our

128
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,610
province one name I married Labrador and

129
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:37,820
for some reason my dad who passed away

130
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,080
four years ago was written down

131
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,240
as the best man so she had done a barren

132
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,140
ceiling she had done a bunch of pre

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,760
filling out this this flower so the

134
00:05:48,140 --> 00:06:00,320
whole thing was very but I married my

135
00:05:52,760 --> 00:06:05,420
sister-in-law married married or either

earbuds they're Bluetooth 4.1 completely

284

think about Wireless in your buds right

285
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,220

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,670
definition of a wireless earbud should I

288
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,350
show you mine and then you can maybe

289
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,000
write all right what do you picture when

290
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,440
you picture wireless earbuds these are

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,449
the ones I've been using for years okay

292
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,519
there's some that Wireless there

293
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:10,060
bluetooth oh yeah they connect to my

294
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:12,610
phone or my mp3 player right and when I

295
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,060
when I'm jogging cuz I jog right that's

296
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,490
what I do

297
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,949
obviously right what are they doing your

298
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,060
job they stay in the cable this thing

299
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,490
here it's got a little bit of a weight

300
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,290
to it and it will actually pull that out

301
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,079
of my ear and it's like ah it's

302
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,060
frustrating as you say it's not quite

303
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,970
Wireless they're great these are great

304
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,130
but they're not quite Wireless tonight

305
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,220
we're gonna be introducing you to Joe

306
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,750
visas new product line we've got the

307
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,589
shield we've got the beat winds I'm

308
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,829
going to show you the difference between

309
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:46,649
them they are the first the only the

310
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:49,959
best fully wireless earbuds I'm talking

311
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:52,740
over the moon about this think about

312
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:57,940
this wireless in your ears none of this

313
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,820
and wireless charging perfect let's take

314
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,100
a look here we go

315
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,930
this is the box for the shield this is

316
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,570
the box for the B twins now why have we

317
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,800
got both well they are there's a little

318
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,420
bit of a difference in price we're going

319
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,510
to talk a little bit about that but

320
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,310
essentially these are similar devices

321
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,560
they're earbuds right so if you've got

322
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,300
somebody who's an audiophile fan of

323

music on your Christmas list these are

324
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,560
what you want to be looking at first of

325
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,690
all we're gonna look at the shield now

326
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,640
both of these there there are some real

327
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,220
similarities between them ok Sasha

328
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,720
both of these are truly wireless I'm

329
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,519
talking no wires you're gonna see how

330
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,819
that is accomplished in just a couple of

331
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,350
moments also both of them have been nano

332
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:42,130
coated do you know what that means

333
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:44,079
no that means that if you are using

334
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,059
these for workouts if you're jogging if

335
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,889
you're at the

336
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:49,619
if you're doing your jumping jacks or

337
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:51,299
jump squats uh-huh if you're sweating

338
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:53,399
you're not gonna have to worry about

339
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:55,169
your ear buds basically you know I don't

340
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,329
think they would call them waterproof

341
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,829
but you don't have to worry about sweat

342
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:00,869
that's for sure so they are absolutely

343
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:02,309
sweat proof they're going to work for

344
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,809
you you're not gonna have a problem with

345
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:05,549
that so both of these are like that

346
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,709
they're both wireless they're both you

347
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:09,239
know they're essentially similar devices

348
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,429
with a couple of differences between

349
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:14,659
them we're gonna show you so let's get

350
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:18,119
into the shield and this one goes for

351
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:20,789
$79.99 now this week for cyber week it's

352
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:22,439
on sale for just $59.99 so just a heads

353
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:24,029
up for you and there you go so that's

354
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:25,949
what's in the box so you see that we've

355
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,109
got some kind of behind the ear hanging

356
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:30,659
things these are going to help if you

357
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:31,949
are really roughing it if you're you

358
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,819
know jogging through the forest or

359
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:34,679
something like that you're doing

360
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:35,819
something that you really want to make

361
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,559
sure that they're gonna stay on your ear

362
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:39,719
but these are entirely optional

363
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,239
now the earbuds themselves this is the

364
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:43,829
jeebies shield just see if I can get one

365
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:47,849
out here there we go

366
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:48,449
that's all there is to it oh that's

367
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:51,959
sharp

368
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:53,669
that's our left ear and let's get it out

369
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,419
here don't worry you only got to do this

370
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:58,679
once folks there get underneath and pop

371
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:00,569
it out there we are

372
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:04,319
so there's our two ears how do you like

373
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:07,799
that now both sets of these jobbies ear

374
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:09,959
buds have just simple touch controls and

375
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,549
they do support things that you know

376
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,799
what you would expect from a bluetooth

377
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:15,689
earbud these days like being able to

378
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,879
make and take calls being able to

379
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:22,859
control your phone let's make sure I've

380
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:26,129
got the right ear here nice you just

381
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:27,779
talk to me oh it did yeah we'll get into

382
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:30,839
the sizing in just a moment so these

383
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,219
ones this is the shield and I can hear

384
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,959
that it's kind of muted the sound in

385
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:36,419
here so that's what they look like on me

386
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:38,699
and that's just pushed into my ear

387
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,169
there's no behind the ear strap there's

388
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:43,429
nothing going behind my head there's

389
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:45,869
nothing hanging but beneath my chin

390
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:48,059
there you have it so how did they charge

391
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:50,759
that's the question you see these little

392
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:52,889
proprietary little ports they look like

393
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,989
and I said they're Wireless right I

394
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:56,600
promised you that let's take a look at

395
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:59,240
how this thing works this

396
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,389
is one of those innovations that I love

397
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,459
from Jabez now we saw something similar

398
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:06,170
with the last set of job easier buds

399
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:08,060
that we looked at and if you're

400
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,380
hard-of-hearing if you've got hearing

401
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,720
problems you want to check those ones

402
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,730
out there called the jeebies amp sound

403
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,850
you can actually check those ones out at

404
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:19,190
cat5 dot TV slash amp sound what they do

405
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,160
differently is they also act as hearing

406
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,019
aids so we kind of saw this technology

407
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,269
but this is the evolution of that

408
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,949
without the hearing aid component these

409
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:31,990
are specifically from use that can and

410
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:34,550
calls but let's get into the accessories

411
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,519
all right we've got a wire I told you it

412
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:40,759
was Wireless don't you worry I'll show

413
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,709
you how it works now that's all that's

414
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,230
in the box we've got a little carrying

415
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:46,910
case now we remember Joby's is very

416
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:50,120
innovative with their carrying cases

417
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:53,870
what do we notice we've got a USB input

418
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:58,880
on the case no USB input on the earbuds

419
00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:01,790
themselves but when you put the earbuds

420
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,100
into the case which is a nice hard shell

421
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:07,189
protective case right

422
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,169
they magnetically suck themselves into

423
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:11,179
the case into the right spot you push

424
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:15,350
the power button and those babies are

425
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:17,449
charging look at that put that away put

426
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,449
it in your pocket it's really really

427
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:22,610
tiny there you have it and then when

428
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:24,770
you're ready to use them there you go so

429
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,140
both sets of earbuds are going to last

430
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,630
for three hours if you're listening to

431
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:32,090
music for hours if you're making them

432
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:35,510
taking calls and standby is a whopping

433
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:38,929
50 hours ok so there you have it you

434
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,730
asked about sizing size yes alright no

435
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:44,750
problem there we've got 2 different

436
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:48,440
types of what do you call these like

437
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:51,380
in-ear adapt doors to make it fit you

438
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,570
more snugly we've got little itty-bitty

439
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,909
tiny ones for the tiny ears and we've

440
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,830
got some larger kind of circular shaped

441
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,809
ones these ones are more or oval like

442
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:03,130
and then we've got a couple other little

443
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:05,950
things here these are

444
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:09,990
like sweat seals and little pegs that

445
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:12,820
you can plug in where the behind-the-ear

446
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,260
component which we looked at over here

447
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,910
thanks guys here when we're not using

448
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,860
these we can actually put one of these

449
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,740
pegs into the hole so that it keeps any

450
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,539
water or moisture out of that there we

451
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:28,660
go so that's how I'd probably want to

452
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:31,840
use it okay so that is the jeebies

453
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:35,950
shield again $79.99 and they're on sale

454
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,110
this week for cyber week for 59.99 so

455
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,669
let's get into the be twins these are

456
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,640
japaese be twins

457
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:44,710
now a little bit different here you can

458
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,500
see different presentation a little bit

459
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,710
of a step up in that regard let's

460
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,710
actually get right in there and get a

461
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,440
look at the B twins now their clips are

462
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,929
in fact in the ear clips so these

463
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,340
actually go into the inside of your ear

464
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,280
they don't go around the back of your

465
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,110
ear a little bit different and what I

466
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,559
notice here that you may not notice at

467
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:11,500
home as far as difference goes is that

468
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,049
the shield are made of plastic a nice

469
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,049
durable plastic with the coating however

470
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:20,260
these are aluminum they have a really

471
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:22,510
good you know the the whole design of

472
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,640
Jimmy's the products are fantastic I

473
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,380
love these but there you go so how do

474
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,289
these fit in my ear let's just kind of

475
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:33,610
get a look here how do these differ from

476
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:35,140
the shield they lighter weight they look

477
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,450
like perhaps they are super lightweight

478
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,240
so I'm just pushing this little guy up

479
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,880
in here and it just kind of clips in you

480
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,980
feel that area of your ear it just goes

481
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,900
right in there these are definitely

482
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:51,159
manly ones bright pink there you go so

483
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,740
that's what they look like this is the

484
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,929
bee twins

485
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,059
so the bee twins also have an upgraded

486
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,429
sound driver so the speaker themselves

487
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:05,110
are higher-end and again they are an

488
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:07,450
aluminum bodied ear but these also have

489
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,309
another unique feature sacha again they

490
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,830
are completely wireless there is no wire

491
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:14,429
going between them and the bee twins in

492
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,200
fact act as two

493
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:18,869
for it Bluetooth devices so your left

494
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,570
and right ear are in fact two different

495
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:24,179
devices you can mount those to a phone

496
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,710
or an mp3 player that has Bluetooth or

497
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,929
any device with Bluetooth a computer

498
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,450
even and you can listen to your music in

499
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:34,740
full beautiful stereo with deep lows and

500
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:37,080
nice crystal clear crisp treble but what

501
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,429
that means to you is that you can also

502
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,369
put this one away

503
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,799
and just use one right then you can

504
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:47,100
actually use this one connected to a

505
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:49,289
different device if you would like

506
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,240
so there are use cases you might be able

507
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:54,379
to think of some places where that would

508
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,340
be you know a neat neat idea right

509
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,659
certainly if you want to share you know

510
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,269
if you want to use one and I'll use one

511
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:01,369
if you're going on the motorcycle and

512
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:05,279
you want to be able to talk with Dave

513
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:07,619
that's perfect there you go perfect okay

514
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,850
so again we know jubie's we know how

515
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:10,889
they do things we know how their

516
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,019
chargers work this again comes with a

517
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:15,929
nice little carrying case this one is a

518
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:19,440
belt clip model and we've got a little

519
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:21,419
reveal here for the USB input to charge

520
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,289
the case can you imagine that you're

521
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:29,580
charging the case then when we open that

522
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:34,519
up take your earbud and just set it

523
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,519
right down in there done and

524
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,340
just align that with the with the magnet

525
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:44,540
there there we go

526
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,640
close it down and turn it on there you

527
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,760
go so now my earbuds are in fact

528
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,200
charging while they're not in use once

529
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,180
it's finished charging it'll stop

530
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,430
charging and then the next time I open

531
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,360
it up I pull out my earbuds they are

532
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,030
ready to go

533
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,000
that's the jeebies be twins so these

534
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,100
both of these devices are absolutely

535
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,160
exceptional so that we're seeing the

536
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,720
evolution of earbuds here folks if

537
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,420
you're a music fan like myself I

538
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,370
absolutely love constantly listening to

539
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:16,610
music I've always got music playing I

540
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:19,640
love I actually use my laptop a lot with

541
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,410
Bluetooth and the bee twins so it's not

542
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,540
just for phones anymore so you can sync

543
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:26,630
it with your with your computer your

544
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,520
laptop your tablet your phone your mp3

545
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,920
player my son has an mp3 player that has

546
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,770
bluetooth so we use bluetooth on that

547
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,930
and there you have it so any other

548
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,060
points with the difference now oh the

549
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,300
question is coming in about the price of

550
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:43,970
the beat wins a little bit more regular

551
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,970
price is $99 again these are aluminum

552
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,470
they're a little bit higher end

553
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,300
certainly the drivers are upgraded so

554
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,600
the sound quality on these is going to

555
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,830
be probably yeah I say probably I know

556
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,510
this is probably gonna be the best

557
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,970
sounding year bud you've ever heard be

558
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,250
it wired or Wireless that's a fact

559
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,610
this is the jeebies your be twins

560
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,920
earbuds now at $99 that's a steal but

561
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,170
again cyber week this week if you're

562
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:14,840
shopping right now for Christmas it's on

563
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:16,820

564
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,860
have it both come in multiple different

565
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,020
colors are there any points that I've

566
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:25,970
missed sash I think I I think you got it

567
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:29,600
all Wow first shot I especially love

568
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:32,510
because I ride my bike right like a

569
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,730
pedal bike a pedal bike ride my bike in

570
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:38,840
this spring summer and fall to and from

571
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:42,070
the studio and I have like I had a like

572
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,170
a Bluetooth just like earbud thing

573
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,730
I was using for fun and music kind of

574
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:49,150
thing yeah that doesn't sound anything

575
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:51,430
like these I like the Google Maps just

576
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,780
that tells me where to okay right so

577
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,800
just in case you get lost on your way to

578
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,740
the studio that you've been to a

579
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:01,990
thousand times but the one that I was

580
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,760
using and I mean it's just the typical

581
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,700
one you would use right so it would

582
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,840
always pop out and like these looks

583
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,140
secure

584
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,480
absolutely oh speaking of secure and and

585
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,550
you mentioned about the size of your

586
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,170
ears so Sasha's got the little ears I

587
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,210
got the bigger ones let's get into the

588
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:23,290
box here of the B twins and see what

589
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:25,060
else comes with it here we go okay some

590
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:27,700
instruction manuals some information

591
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,970
there then we've got same thing we've

592
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,950
got lots of different sizes there you go

593
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,500
there's two more these ones all have the

594
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,600
these ones have that kind of flap that

595
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,710
goes to hold it a little more solidly in

596
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,390
your ear so it doesn't fall out when

597
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,400
you're working out and then we've got

598
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,960
these ones do not so if you prefer not

599
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,030
to have that you've got that option

600
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,610
we've got a registration card some

601
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:51,910
information and a USB cable oh and some

602
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:54,400
more adapter things for the ears and the

603
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:58,540
USB cable again is so that you can

604
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,950
charge the case so you never chart

605
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,650
you're never having to actually plug in

606
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,500
the earbuds themselves you're charging

607
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,920
the case and then you've got a case here

608
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:12,820
that will actually give you about nine

609
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:16,240
nine hours of charging so how do you

technology TV and during the break

654
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,650
there's a show we were talking about

655
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,540
well we've got a little bit of extra

656
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,370
time tonight and as I mentioned we've

657
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,920
been sent all this cool stuff to review

658
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:21,650
and so we've got enough time to show you

659
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,750
one more what I think is a really cool

660
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,970
little gadget something to put in your

661
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:28,480
tool chest this is something that I

662
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:32,060
think should probably be in everybody's

663
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:36,650
stocking you think that a I do the

664
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:38,600
plastic welder plastic welder right so

665
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,270
what I want to show you is what's called

666
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,470
bondic and it's this little guy here and

667
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:49,160
you pick these up a cat5 dot TV slash

668
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:53,030
bondic and all it is is a simple resin

669
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:57,530
that solidifies only when exposed to

670
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:59,990
ultraviolet light okay so what could

671
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,220
this be used for so first of all as I

672
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,890
said this is something that should be in

673
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,390
everybody's talking because I have

674
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,500
already used this a million and one

675
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,000
times now we were joking and kind

676
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,560
laughing a little bit there during the

677
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,830
break because I don't have anything I

678
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,740
can show you to fix because it's so easy

679
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:19,920
it's so quick that I I have fixed

680
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,590
everything so what I love about bondic

681
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,870
is when my kids bring me a toy when they

682
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,340
bring me something that needs fixing and

683
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,830
this has happened several times in the

684
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,480
past couple of weeks since I got it I'm

685
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,850
able to fix it right then and there so

686
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,040
super dad there you go

687
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,680
I'm actually you know I don't have to oh

688
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,480
well I'll put some superglue on it and

689
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,880
I'll let it set overnight and we'll hope

690
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,190
for the best no this is instantaneous

691
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,240
repair and I can fix something really

692
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,800
really quick so that's what I've been

693
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,270
doing for my kids and that's what I've

694
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,910
been doing for myself so I got this

695
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:52,800
because my laptop I don't know if you

696
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,980
can see this very clearly I'll see if I

697
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:59,730
can hold this up right here see that oh

698
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:03,390
that has been bondic so the chassis of

699
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:06,000
my laptop snapped it broke and so the

700
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:08,250
cable the charging cable was very very

701
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,840
loose it was jiggly and I was afraid

702
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,390
that it was eventually going to snap off

703
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,980
of the motherboard so I got bondic so

704
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,770
that I could actually replace the

705
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,990
plastic with this resin and then make it

706
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:21,660
solid and it is absolutely solid and now

707
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,980
my power supply does not jiggle on the

708
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,950
motherboard I didn't have to take the

709
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,090
laptop apart you probably wouldn't have

710
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,070
noticed it even though you know the

711
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,870
close-up it doesn't look super super

712
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,970
pretty because I didn't do you know that

713
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,130
I didn't care that much about making it

714
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,750
look perfect I could have taken the

715
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,510
chassis apart and done a nicer job but

716
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:42,300
it's functional it fixed it and I saved

717
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:44,130
potentially a lot of money because had

718
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,570
that broken my motherboard it would have

719
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,370
snapped something off of the motherboard

720
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,650
and could have been a hundred hundred

721
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,800
fifty dollars to get that fixed maybe

722
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,220
more if it was a serious issue so how

723
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,710
does it work

724
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,150
so let's actually build this up just a

725
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,090
little bit I'm just gonna take a little

726
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:01,590
bit of the resin and just kind of

727
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:04,770
dribble it on here and it's just a

728
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,660
liquid and you've probably seen bondic

729
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,980
before but if you're like me you're

730
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,220
looking at the reviews and wondering

731
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,830
does it really work is it actually worth

732
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,420
the price to go and get one of these now

733
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,100
that I've put the liquid there and it's

734
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,380
gonna stay liquid until I exposed it to

735
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,090
ultraviolet light as soon as I'm done I

736
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,249
can just you know if I'm half

737
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:26,519
with the position I can just expose it

738
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:28,590
to the ultraviolet light how long do you

739
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,950
have to expose it for before five

740
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:35,249
seconds oh it's instantaneous so now

741
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:37,139
that is solid it's a little bit tacky to

742
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:40,919
my fingers so I can just expose the

743
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:43,499
light a little bit more literally in

744
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,990
that amount of time there that is solid

745
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:48,440
plastic now so you can see that I built

746
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:52,230
that up just a little bit more there and

747
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,029
that has saved my laptop essentially so

748
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,399
the other thing that I've done with it

749
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:57,720
Sasha my son I mentioned earlier in the

750
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,490
show if you're watching the entire

751
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,100
full-length episode that he has a

752
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,529
Bluetooth mp3 player well the buttons

753
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,450
stopped working so I took it apart and

754
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:09,210
it turned out that on the underside of

755
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,369
the buttons is a little peg that pushes

756
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,110
down on the circuit board and the

757
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:16,740
circuit board has buttons that get

758
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,119
depressed right well the the back side

759
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,159
the underside of the plastic buttons

760
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:21,539
were not quite long enough to push the

761
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,759
buttons all the way so he'd have to push

762
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,830
really really hard like just bondic and

763
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,960
I just put a little bit more plastic on

764
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:30,779
there and then I solidified it with the

765
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,980
ultraviolet light and now his mp3 player

766
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,840
works perfectly the buttons worked

767
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,220
perfectly you're like a magic dad it

768
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,470
really kind of feels that way my

769
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,539
littlest is six years old turning seven

770
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,639
next week and he brings me things like

771
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:43,289
he has a plastic coin that he broke in

772
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:46,639
half and I don't know how that happened

773
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:49,289
but dad just pulls this out fixes it

774
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:50,999
solidifies it and it's instant fix and

775
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:54,480
it's just been one thing after another

776
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:56,669
like that so go get one cat5 dot TV

777
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,820
slash bondic again perfect little thing

778
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:01,889
to throw into into somebody stalking I

779
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,960
think everybody should have this it's

780
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:07,590
been a real it's been a real help around

781
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,860
the house for sure it's actually very

782
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,749
cool it works I was skeptical I was

783
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,389
skeptical from the reviews on Amazon

784
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:16,769
right and it does work I you know what

785
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:18,240
I'm even thinking in a pinch if you

786
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,129
broke your glasses or something and just

787
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,600
to get you through glasses are another

788
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:23,549
great example I've got a pair of my

789
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,919
favorite sunglasses got broken the the

790
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:28,110
basically the side part here got snapped

791
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,399
and I'm gonna use bondic to fix it

792
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,350
they're just in the other van so I

793
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,850
haven't done that yet

794
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:34,179
that's one of the one of the things I

795
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:38,559
want to fix way better than tape Robbie

796
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:42,140
that's how I usually do it masking tape

797
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,299
perfect so we head over to the newsroom

798
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,760
and see what's up let's do it

799
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:48,260
all right here are the stories were

800
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,799
covering this week in the category five

801
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,450
TV newsroom fake news is now being used

802
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:55,130
by criminals for financial and

803
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,000
commercial gain will tell you how

804
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,549
they're doing it

805
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,350
Tesla has launched an electric transport

806
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:04,400
truck that a guarantees won't break down

807
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:06,740
for a million miles drone maker DJI made

808
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,659
a big security mistake and in trying to

809
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,490
cover it up they're going after that you

810
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:13,610
reported it through their bug bounty

811
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:16,309
program and a severely dangerous exploit

812
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,380
on Intel CPUs has users scrambling to

813
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:20,390
update their firmwares will tell you

814
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,640

following this week according to new

840
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,919
research criminals are exploiting fake

841
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,810
news for commercial gain fake news is

842
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:37,270
widely assumed to be political or

843
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:39,540
ideological propaganda or even outright

844
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:42,639
lies published to sway public opinion

845
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,710
but new research conducted by threat

846
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,050
intelligence firm digital shadows and

847
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:49,330
released on Thursday suggested that fake

848
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,879
news generation services are now aimed

849
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:53,530
at causing financial and reputation

850
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,500
damage for companies through

851
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:57,580
misinformation campaigns so how are they

852
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,060
using this to make money

853
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:03,610
it's called pump and dump scan these

854
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,440
schemers are aggressively promoting

855
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,650
penny stocks to inflate their prices

856
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,960
before they inevitably crash and burn

857
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:13,030
the scammers buy low then promote their

858
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,220
stock using fake news social engineering

859
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,090
tactics and media BOTS enabling them to

860
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,920
sell high

861
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,920
then they flee with their loot and

862
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,840
little regard for other investors

863
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,910
Digital shadows also identified more

864
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,800
than 10 services that allow users to

865
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,320
download software that controls the

866
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,450
activities of social media bots the

867
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,550
tools work by controlling large numbers

868
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:36,550
of bots to post on specific types of

869
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,410
forums on different topics to trick

870
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:40,630
people into believing their fake news

871
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:43,180
sites the fraudsters have also resorted

872
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,610
to spoofing legitimate sites by altering

873
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,260
characters on a registered domain such

874
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,680
as replacing the letter

875
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:52,869
with an RN and using cloning services

876
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,840
they're able to create convincing fake

877
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:57,880
news sites Digital shadow advises that

878
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,850
you can protect yourself by monitoring

879
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,250
social media for brand mentions and seek

880
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:05,080
to detect the bots using clues such as

881
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,060
the age of the account the content being

882
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,750
posted and the number of friends or

883
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:14,380
followers hmm and we tend to use what's

884
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:16,119
trending as that's where we get a lot of

885
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,440
our news right exactly you know what

886
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,510
they spoke to me a little bit because

887
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,250
Dave's really been getting a little bit

888
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,800
more into the stock market so okay yeah

889
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:27,670
interested in a stock he does a lot of

890
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:30,369
research on it using the internet so

891
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:32,320
what are people talking about well if

892
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:34,750
there's 10,000 BOTS all talking about it

893
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,140
is it yeah all of a sudden the interest

894
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,910
grows the stock price goes up I it's

895
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:43,119
dangerous and you see is it going up

896
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:45,460
right and you know to be honest with you

897
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,800
I kind of give a lot of credit probably

898
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,470
to like the more savvy people I feel

899
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:54,670
like you could probably tell I mean RN

900
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:57,670
it does look like um yeah on your

901
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:00,609
computer it's amazing I feel like there

902
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,619
there are some red flags that probably

903
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:07,780
you would be able to tell if you were

904
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:09,400
savvy but the elderly that aren't so

905
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,720
into it and now all of a sudden they're

906
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,910
not getting their news from any other

907
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,280
source except for the internet and

908
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:18,070
there's that whole like everything you

909
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,800
read on the Internet is true thing that

910
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:24,010
happens with people's minds I'm

911
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,170
wondering whether or not it's going to

912
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:29,260
end up being like a lesson that they're

913
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:32,109
gonna have to learn in schools and stuff

914
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,000
like it's gonna be maybe part of you

915
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:36,850
know you cite your sources when you're

916
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,500
writing an essay now all of a sudden

917
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,180
you're gonna probably have to take that

918
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,070
extra level because you're gonna have to

919
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,109
cite your source and proof yeah and and

920
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:46,060
we do this here on the show and other

921
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:47,590
newscasters do this if they're you know

922
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,200
if they care about the legitimacy of

923
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:53,710
stories is we look for multiple

924
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:56,380
instances of the story of the news of

925
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,660
the the topic so if I'm looking at a

926
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,290
stock and I see that it's going up see

927
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,200
this is a tough thing though what is

928
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:05,630
driving the stock up mm-hmm so if if

929
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,520
news and social engineering tactics are

930
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:09,920
what's driving the stock up then yes the

931
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,170
stock is going up so every site is going

932
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,580
to say the stock is going up but what's

933
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:16,730
causing it that's a really difficult

934
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:19,130
thing now with something like a spoofed

935
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,600
website that is faking news and tricking

936
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,790
people into reading a spoofed

937
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,560
information well I think there are a

938
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:28,100
couple of things that we can do first of

939
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:31,040
all this guy over here he set they have

940
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:34,130
anti-malware that will help - it's

941
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,990
called anti-phishing which will help to

942
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:40,370
protect you from websites that are

943
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:43,010
tricking you into going to fake websites

944
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:45,110
those kinds of things so it helps but

945
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,900
also knowing the difference between the

946
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:50,690
address bar and the search on your

947
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,610
computer that's a big deal because and I

948
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:54,380
see this all the time in our industry

949
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,650
and it makes it breaks my heart every

950
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:02,180
time that I see someone search for

951
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:05,240
Google they or search for my company's

952
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:07,340
website address don't do that if you

953
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,940
know you're going to Microsoft com or

954
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:13,010
BBC co uk

955
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,560
it in the address bar that is the

956
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:19,370
address when you have someone's phone

957
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:22,400
number you don't call someone else and

958
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:25,010
say hi I've got this phone number can

959
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,230
you put me through to Joe at five five

960
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:29,480
five five five five five it doesn't work

961
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:31,100
that way so why are we searching for

962
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,320
Microsoft com

963
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:36,620
why are we searching for the news sites

964
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:39,140
or our banking sites that's where we get

965
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:41,830
tricked because we're entering into a

966
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,320
search engine which gives us results and

967
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:47,540
sometimes tens of thousands of results

968
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,190
for those things and so if somebody

969
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:53,300
happened to get up at the top of the

970
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:56,720
list for BBC Co UK

971
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,520
of SEO guess what you're gonna click on

972
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,440
it if that's the way that you surf the

973
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,350
Internet right when you know the address

974
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:06,890
go to the address in the address bar

975
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:08,930
don't use your search very good yeah

976
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:11,780
those are a couple of little tactics but

977
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:13,850
recognizing the signs - like knowing

978
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,920
that kerning can cause our

979
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,990
and to look like em brightening that

980
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,940
yeah you have to know what the red flags

981
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:22,340
really are and a big one in social

982
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,740
social media is really like the friends

983
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:27,440
and followers of the actual person

984
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,730
posting true yeah if you see something

985
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,170
happening on social media that's

986
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,970
trending and it's coming from all of

987
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,840
these accounts and you know thousands of

988
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,240
people are talking about it

989
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,690
view the accounts look at the accounts

990
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,940
and say okay who follows this person who

991
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:44,150
does this person follow and you can

992
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:47,000
usually spot fake bought accounts

993
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,650
because they use weird names all the

994
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,780
girls look like supermodels and they're

995
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:54,380
wearing bikinis you know there's these

996
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:56,630
kinds of signs that it is BOTS because

997
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,940
they grab photos from various websites

998
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,190
in order to create photos for their BOTS

999
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,810
and so you see those kinds of things and

1000
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:07,610
you know they're they're red flags and

1001
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:09,610
if you see you just gotta kind of watch

1002
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:12,710
for it ask somebody who's really savvy

1003
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,870
that's a great way yea there's no shame

1004
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:17,030
in asking absolutely not sometimes I

1005
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,980
have phone calls that say I know this is

1006
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,050
a stupid question I'm so sorry to

1007
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:25,010
trouble you and I appreciate that I love

1008
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:26,540
it when a customer says that but I have

1009
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:28,580
this pop-up on my computer and it says

1010
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,810
do this it says call Microsoft here's

1011
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,390
the number mm-hmm

1012
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:34,040
do I call no that's actually an ad

1013
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:37,340
that's coming in for an infected

1014
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:40,550
advertisement so close that and and the

1015
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:45,170
near be safe right so thank you Ravi

1016
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:47,360
asking yes Tesla has launched an

1017
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,820
electric transport truck it guarantees

1018
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:53,420
won't break down for a million miles

1019
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:55,520
Elon Musk has launched the Tesla semi

1020
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,740
complete with a guarantee that it will

1021
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,230
not break down for 1 million miles of

1022
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,180
driving speaking at a launch event in

1023
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,640
Los Angeles musk said that the truck

1024
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,620
will be 20% cheaper to operate than a

1025
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,960
diesel truck in part because it will be

1026
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:14,510
faster the truck has a drag coefficient

1027
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,710
of 0.36 that's crazy that's less than

1028
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,140
some supercars

1029
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,810
the bullet-like design means that it can

1030
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:24,020
go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 20

1031
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,470
seconds while hauling a full 80,000

1032
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,560
pound

1033
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,900
load Oh the truck can reach this speed

1034
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,119
up Hills with a five percent gradient

1035
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,290
which Lou which Elon Musk says will

1036
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:37,790
leave Diesel's

1037
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:39,770
eating dust range is 500 my the range is

1038
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:42,080
500 miles on a charge with a full load

1039
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:43,430
traveling at 60 miles per hour this is

1040
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,550
starting to sound like a word Pro hold

1041
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:49,220
for longer trips Tesla will install mega

1042
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:51,500
chargers that musk said will add 400

1043
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,890
miles of range with just a 30-minute

1044
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,710
charge

1045
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:56,810
what's more the research facilities will

1046
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:58,670
be solar powered and Tesla will

1047
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:02,300
guarantee the price of recharge

1048
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:05,090
recharges the truck will have one engine

1049
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,830
on each of its four wheels a design musk

1050
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,960
said will prevent jackknifing as

1051
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:11,780
automation ensures each wheel does what

1052
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,760
it takes to avoid such accidents braking

1053
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,609
energy will be recaptured to charge the

1054
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,250
batteries autopilot will be built-in and

1055
00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:20,930
enabled in all trucks musk said that in

1056
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,490
doing so it will ensure that the

1057
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:25,460
vehicles always stay within their lanes

1058
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:27,670
if a driver is incapacitated the truck

1059
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:31,280
will park itself and call for assistance

1060
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:33,349
the truck can also run in a convoy where

1061
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,130
one or several semi trucks will be able

1062
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:39,170
to autonomously follow a lead semi such

1063
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,510
convoy is Max musk said will deliver

1064
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:44,630
Freight at a lower cost and rail

1065
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:47,660
transport musk says the trucks will go

1066
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:50,210
on sale in the year 2019 but declined to

1067
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:53,540
name a price and instead roof referred

1068
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,920
to the cost of ownership metrics in

1069
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,940
other words very expensive very

1070
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:03,260
expensive but Wow will save you a bundle

1071
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:05,660
of money and safe keep you saving will

1072
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,520
call for a help if the driver is

1073
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,890
incapacitated it sounds like you

1074
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,500
probably don't even need a driver

1075
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,030
probably at some point wait some point

1076
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,099
they I mean the convoy thing I think

1077
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,470
about the the freight liner innovation

1078
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:21,550
truck as an example where the convoy

1079
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:24,020
thing it's so aerodynamic it's so

1080
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:26,330
they're so close together because of the

1081
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,820
autonomous driving that it's like a

1082
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,070
train and it basically you know you know

1083
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,080
that if you get into the wind tunnel of

1084
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:35,119
a transport truck it's gonna pull you

1085
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,440
along and you can just kind of coast so

1086
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,160
imagine if you've got a convoy of trucks

1087
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,990
that are

1088
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:43,160
driving that close together and these

1089
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:44,390
trucks are incredibly aerodynamic as far

1090
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,309
as safety goes one of the things that

1091
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:49,970
our that wasn't mentioned in the story

1092
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:52,430
that I had seen in the video is that it

1093
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:56,180
has armored glass as well so the

1094
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:59,509
windshield is armored that is fantastic

1095
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:02,690
so like what trucker wouldn't want this

1096
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:05,269
right and even having something that's

1097
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:07,759
even if a trucker needed to be in the

1098
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:09,950
truck if see I work at a chiropractic

1099
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:12,859
clinic right and because of that I see

1100
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:14,450
people with various numbers of injuries

1101
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:17,380
and ailments especially work-related

1102
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:21,109
additive stress injuries and postures

1103
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:23,269
truck drivers have incredibly by and

1104
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:24,980
large kind of as a rule incredibly

1105
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:27,230
damaged spines and it's because they

1106
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:30,049
have been sitting for a long periods of

1107
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:34,279
time sure with minimal breaks wear and

1108
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:36,289
tear on their body is crazy this this

1109
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:38,480
truck you can stand up yeah there's

1110
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:41,750
standing room this would be a

1111
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,630
game-changer you'd become less um I

1112
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,670
guess confined to the the wheel right

1113
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,319
and more just kind of the overseer

1114
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,730
that's a phone I'm not sure how

1115
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,940
autonomous it's going to be out of the

1116
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:55,430
box but I know that it's going to have

1117
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:56,990
the ability to stay in the lane so you

1118
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,279
know if you're driving and you know

1119
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,170
hands are off the wheel and it's gonna

1120
00:45:58,279 --> 00:46:02,029
stay in the lane it's gonna have

1121
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,829
collision avoidance and automatic

1122
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:04,970
stopping to avoid collisions things like

1123
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:07,730
that that you would expect from Tesla

1124
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:10,400
and you know probably you know that's

1125
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,990
just phase one right yeah the first

1126
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,730
thing that popped through my head when I

1127
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:16,250
read this news story was a couple weeks

1128
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:19,789
ago on a highway really close to here we

1129
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:23,720
had a massive accident and what was the

1130
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:24,710
cause Sasha it was well it was trucks

1131
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,200
trucks

1132
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:32,299
it was trucks and and one a couple of

1133
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:36,140
the trucks were carrying gas gas and so

1134
00:46:32,299 --> 00:46:39,940
when they collided it caused a boom it

1135
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:42,980
was like a zit not great it was

1136
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,740
catastrophic catastrophic it was I just

1137
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,310
one word at a time

1138
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:51,420
yeah there was it

1139
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:54,510
is insanely dangerous people people

1140
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,520
could have been completely wiped out

1141
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:57,960
luckily not as many people died as you

1142
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,740
would have thought it's miraculous how

1143
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:04,890
few actually died but but it didn't have

1144
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:07,290
to happen at all if these trucks were

1145
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:08,820
already on the road I think as a you

1146
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,890
know and if you're a trucker you can

1147
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:13,200
even comment below let us know what you

1148
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,940
think but I would imagine as a trucker

1149
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,600
you like Sasha said you're working long

1150
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:20,730
hours you're not moving a lot and if I'm

1151
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,660
drivin late at night for long hours in

1152
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,490
my van

1153
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,290
I start to my mind starts to wander and

1154
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:28,140
I and then I snap out of it and realize

1155
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,030
oh I better pay attention but you know

1156
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:33,150
how much more so if you're hauling a

1157
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:35,430
load right and somebody all of a sudden

1158
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,410
stops in front of you well this truck

1159
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:39,570
will stop so we know about autonomous

1160
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:40,920
vehicles and that's that's great we know

1161
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,710
that that's coming we know that it's

1162
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,600
here and and it's it's available what

1163
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:48,660
Tesla is doing differently now is it

1164
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:51,750
doesn't need gas right and it will do

1165
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,690
500 miles on a single charge like you're

1166
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:59,130
talking a two-way transaction of hauling

1167
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:02,220
a load and zero to 60 in five seconds

1168
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,900
that is that's insane that's where the

1169
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,730
full load folks so you think about a

1170
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,100
diesel truck and trying to get onto the

1171
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:09,840
highway and trying to merge into busy

1172
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,640
traffic and that's a danger right there

1173
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,700
you try to get onto a highway in Toronto

1174
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,920
and you take 20 seconds to get up to

1175
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,800
speed or sometimes even longer if you've

1176
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:24,330
got a full load this does away with that

1177
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:27,300
problem I absolutely I'm blown away at

1178
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:29,970
how fast this is progressing 2019 right

1179
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,700
like that's tomorrow it's coming it's

1180
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:33,630
coming yeah and kind of out of the blue

1181
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,560
it feels like I know they've been

1182
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:37,440
talking about it and they're a little

1183
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,210
delayed and in announcing it but it's

1184
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,720
certainly gonna be a game-changer I

1185
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:43,800
think so we're starting to see the Tesla

1186
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,870
gas stations popping up all around

1187
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,540
Barrie as well that's true it actually

1188
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:50,970
it makes me want one very bad well now

1189
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,440
you can start to charge it right and to

1190
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,490
know that it's solar-powered and all

1191
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,530
this kind of stuff and guaranteed

1192
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:58,310
pricing to charge that's kind of cool

1193
00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:00,670
well and the more that happens the last

1194
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:02,380
tanker trucks full of gas

1195
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:04,630
are going to be on the highways causing

1196
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:10,200
accidents yes nobody will need gas

1197
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:10,200
anymore here's hoping will not be neat

1198
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:16,240
drone maker DJI has accused a

1199
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,900
cybersecurity researcher of hacking at

1200
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,809
servers

1201
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,910
Kevin Finisterre claims that he access

1202
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:24,700
confidential customer data after finding

1203
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:27,460
a private key publicly posted on code

1204
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:30,130
sharing site github he approached the

1205
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,780
firm which offers a bug bounty reward of

1206
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,579
up to thirty thousand dollars for

1207
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:36,819
security weaknesses that are discovered

1208
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:39,730
in its systems DJI said that the server

1209
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:42,520
access was unauthorized the data mr.

1210
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:45,010
finis fear was able to see an included

1211
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,440
unencrypted flight logs passports

1212
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:52,210
driver's licenses and identification

1213
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:55,390
cards he said despite initially offering

1214
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:57,790
him the money DJI has now in a statement

1215
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:59,799
accused mr. Finister of refusing to

1216
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:02,079
agree to the terms of its bug bounty

1217
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:04,540
program which are designed to protect

1218
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,190
confidential data and allow time for

1219
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,589
analysis and resolution of a

1220
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,400
vulnerability before it is publicly

1221
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:12,460
disclosed

1222
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,650
mr. finis terrae an independent security

1223
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,440
researcher said DJI tried to make him

1224
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:20,020
sign a nondisclosure agreement

1225
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,240
he also published an email from DJI

1226
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,920
telling him that security issues with

1227
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,950
servers were included in the bug bounty

1228
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,260
program cyber security expert Professor

1229
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:31,869
Alan Woodward from Surrey University

1230
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,609
said DJ eyes actions were outrageous the

1231
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:37,599
public has a right to know when there's

1232
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:40,619
a security problem that's how a bug

1233
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:43,089
bounty program works my friends

1234
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:45,250
everybody does deserve to know one that

1235
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:48,339
there is a problem but not at the

1236
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:51,730
expense of people's safety if a fix

1237
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:55,599
isn't in place one they published a

1238
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:57,220
private key on github that's a publicly

1239
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,040
available website where anyone can view

1240
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:03,010
the code so this guy finds that tests it

1241
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:06,970
to see hey does it actually is this what

1242
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:08,890
I think it is it is oh my goodness I'd

1243
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:11,619
better report this to the bug bounty

1244
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:13,420
program hey guys just so you know you

1245
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:14,900
published this private key which you

1246
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,420
need to change me

1247
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:19,460
I was able to using this key access your

1248
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,800
server and get this data mm-hmm that's

1249
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:24,170
the right methodology of a bug bounty

1250
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,030
program he didn't go out and blast the

1251
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:27,770
world and say hey guys I got all these

1252
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,600
credit card numbers and driver's license

1253
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:30,950
numbers hey do you want them I'll sell

1254
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,230
them to you for twenty thousand dollars

1255
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,790
no that's not how a bug bounty program

1256
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,570
works that's when you would sue a guy

1257
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,850
mm-hmm

1258
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,290
this guy did it right right so what

1259
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:42,530
right do they have to come out and say

1260
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:44,150
okay we're gonna we're gonna give you a

1261
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,050
hard now they wanted a non-disclosure so

1262
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:48,830
in other words they're trying to cover

1263
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:50,870
it up right okay so they suspect that

1264
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,790
somebody else has also gained access to

1265
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:57,500
it and probably stolen that information

1266
00:51:52,790 --> 00:52:00,470
for sale that's a theory but if one guy

1267
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:04,760
was able to do it and you know was the

1268
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:06,260
first guy the the the only guy and the

1269
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,360
real fear is if they were actually

1270
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,010
trying to cover it up which it does seem

1271
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:14,000
like they were doing that's the thing

1272
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:18,020
right then there are like a nameless

1273
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,740
number like of real victims that that

1274
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:23,600
could have been exposed in this and they

1275
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:27,380
would have never owned up to it right

1276
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,120
it's not it's not fair or good of a big

1277
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,840
company like that to do something

1278
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:34,610
I think DJI there's this problem with

1279
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:37,310
them right now in that they're losing a

1280
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:39,770
lot of trust this is not the time to

1281
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:41,720
mess around with people's trust when the

1282
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:44,900
government has said we're pulling all

1283
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:48,470
DJI products from our our military

1284
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,890
because it because we have reason to

1285
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:53,150
suspect that it has tools that are

1286
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:57,440
distributing private information about

1287
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:59,570
the flight plans well suspect it maybe

1288
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,480
it's because they were they were right

1289
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:05,000
maybe they found it on github we're able

1290
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,610
to access that data who knows all right

1291
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,260
not a good time to cover things up and

1292
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:11,210
try to wash them under the under the

1293
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,460
bridge but this guy is saying you know

1294
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:14,870
he's he's publicly said you know this is

1295
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,850
what they've done we've got a emails to

1296
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:18,830
prove that this is what DJI is trying to

1297
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:21,260
do they're trying to cover up this thing

1298
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:23,410
that I found that's not how the bug

1299
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:27,490
bounty program works they need to pay up

1300
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:29,619
kudos to that for standing up and not

1301
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:32,290
Julie just being swept away and signing

1302
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:34,090
the non-disclosure oh man right it could

1303
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:36,220
have gone the other way and then we

1304
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:40,800
would not be talking about it which is

1305
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:40,800
worse than talking about it yeah

1306
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:46,180
Intel admitted Monday that its

1307
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:49,119
management engine server platform

1308
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:52,990
services and trusted execution engine M

1309
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:55,990
e SP s and T XE respectfully are

1310
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:59,020
respectively are vulnerable to multiple

1311
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:01,330
worrying security flaws based on the

1312
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:04,540
findings of external security experts

1313
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:06,760
the firmware level bugs allow logged in

1314
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:09,160
administrators and malicious or hijacked

1315
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,960
high privilege processes to run code

1316
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,660
beneath the operating system to either

1317
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,820
spy or metal with the computer

1318
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:19,300
completely out of sight of other users

1319
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:21,490
and mints meanwhile logged in users or

1320
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,680
malicious or commandeered applications

1321
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:25,390
can leverage the security weaknesses to

1322
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,450
extract confidential and protected

1323
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:30,010
information from the computer's memory

1324
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:31,960
this potentially gives miscreants

1325
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:34,359
sensitive data such as passwords or

1326
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:38,020
cryptographic keys to kick off other

1327
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:40,530
attacks on servers and other shared

1328
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:43,690
machines this is especially bad news in

1329
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:45,760
short a huge number of Intel CPUs are

1330
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:48,190
secretly running code that is buggy and

1331
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,580
exploitable by attackers and malware to

1332
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:53,380
fully and silently compromised computers

1333
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:55,359
Intel's management engine at the heart

1334
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:58,270
of today's disclosure is a computer

1335
00:54:55,359 --> 00:55:00,940
within your computer it is chip sylla's

1336
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:03,490
much-maligned coprocessor at the center

1337
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:06,400
of its vPro suite of features and it is

1338
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:08,590
present in various chip families not

1339
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,200
only does this include servers xeon

1340
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:13,930
processors but also sixth seventh and

1341
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,040
eighth generation Intel Core processors

1342
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:19,869
Apollo lake and some Celeron processors

1343
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,630
the management engine is a barely

1344
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:24,970
documented black box it has its own CPU

1345
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:29,109
on its own operating system recently an

1346
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:32,200
x86 quark core and MINIX that has

1347
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:34,240
complete control over the machine and it

1348
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,400
functions below and out of sight of the

1349
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,770
installed operating system and any

1350
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,900
hypervisors or antivirus tools present

1351
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:42,850
it is designed to

1352
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,560
allow network administrators to remotely

1353
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:46,540
or locally log into a server or

1354
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:49,120
workstation and fix up any errors

1355
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:51,250
reinstall the OS take over the desktop

1356
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,810
and so on which is handy if the box is

1357
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,590
so messed up that it can't even boot

1358
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:56,950
properly

1359
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:58,870
the ME runs closed source remote

1360
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:01,150
administration software to do this and

1361
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:04,210
this code contains bugs which allow

1362
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:07,150
hackers to wield incredible power over a

1363
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:09,400
machine the Emme can be potentially

1364
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:11,740
abused to install root kits and other

1365
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,320
forms of spyware that silently snoop on

1366
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:17,230
users steal information or tamper with

1367
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:20,110
files according to Intel it allows an

1368
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:23,620
attacker to impersonate the ME SPS or

1369
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:26,980
TXE mechanisms thereby invalidating

1370
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:29,110
local security features Intel advises

1371
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:33,040
Microsoft and Linux users to download

1372
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:35,830
and run the Intel s a zero zero zero

1373
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,720
eight six detection tool to determine

1374
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:40,840
whether their systems are vulnerable to

1375
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,390
the above bugs if you are at risk you

1376
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,790
must obtain and install firmware updates

1377
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:47,160
from your computer's manufacturer if and

1378
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:51,400
when they become available

1379
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,600
yikes a great tool if you are a system

1380
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,670
administrator you need to access a

1381
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:57,250
server that is not booting that's not

1382
00:56:54,670 --> 00:57:00,430
working it's remote we co-locate servers

1383
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,720
all the time but scary fact is you think

1384
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:04,330
about all the web servers that are

1385
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:07,240
running Linux or whatever and Linux is

1386
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:09,130
safe it's got CSF lfd firewall on there

1387
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,670
and IP tables and it's all protected and

1388
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:15,010
Fort Knox but guess what this bug

1389
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:16,390
doesn't care if you have a firewall yeah

1390
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,980
it doesn't care if your operating system

1391
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,330
is up to date because it's another

1392
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,740
operating system running in the

1393
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:23,290
background of your computer that you

1394
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:26,590
don't even know is there it has its own

1395
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:29,110
tcp/ip stack they mounted on the network

1396
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:31,990
interface controller so that means that

1397
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:35,520
even if you turn off networking in the

1398
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:38,380
in the OS on your computer this this

1399
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,210
backdoor can still access the network

1400
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,820
can still access the Internet can still

1401
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:45,010
be accessed through that connection how

1402
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,610
many devices are out there running Xeon

1403
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:50,260
processors on an internet connection

1404
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:52,700
directly on the Internet to run web

1405
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:57,290
servers right

1406
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:59,720
that's a scary thought now how how does

1407
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:02,150
this happen like how is this allowed how

1408
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:06,349
can they be releasing these to the

1409
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:09,079
public well it's it's a feature if you

1410
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:10,730
will an under lightly documented

1411
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:12,770
features one that you know not everybody

1412
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:15,319
knows about not everybody use this but

1413
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:18,559
so as a feature that's fantastic I mean

1414
00:58:15,319 --> 00:58:20,630
Dell servers have similar kind of like

1415
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,910
you think about racks and the ability to

1416
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:25,720
connect into servers reboot them access

1417
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:29,950
the BIOS and change things remotely

1418
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:32,210
through a connection to a subsystem chip

1419
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:33,859
that's kind of like that built into the

1420
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,809
processor so it's great from an

1421
00:58:33,859 --> 00:58:37,760
administration standpoint it's great for

1422
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:38,660
Intel to be able to fix servers and

1423
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,730
things like that you think about

1424
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,650
supercomputers and they need to be able

1425
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:45,049
to fix those things without having to

1426
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:49,760
physically go to them and and patch them

1427
00:58:45,049 --> 00:58:52,900
and and anything else but now to find

1428
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:55,460
out that it's so readily exploitable

1429
00:58:52,900 --> 00:59:00,619
which has been a fear of the Electronic

1430
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:05,569
Frontier Freedom Foundation for a long

1431
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:08,380
time and it's true I find it unsettling

1432
00:59:05,569 --> 00:59:10,910
I don't hear a lot in the news about

1433
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:12,829
something that affects Linux users and

1434
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:14,780
when I do it kind of makes me feel a bit

1435
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:16,130
you know well when we mentioned Linux

1436
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,359
because it has nothing to do with the

1437
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,069
operating system installed in the

1438
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,930
computer so understand this is not a

1439
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:24,260
Linux problem this is not a Windows

1440
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:26,210
problem this is a subsystem a

1441
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:29,329
coprocessor chip running an operating

1442
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:31,099
system MINIX on your system at the same

1443
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:34,339
time that you don't even know is

1444
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:36,559
actually running but it is so you want

1445
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:38,270
to definitely use that tool that Intel

1446
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,280
is providing we'll put a link below for

1447
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:42,140
you if you're watching this on cable TV

1448
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,900
or somewhere else where you don't have

1449
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:46,700
access to those links here it is there

1450
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,670
but you can also go to our website

1451
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:54,490
category 5 dot TV and you'll find that

1452
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:57,230
by searching up for episode number 5 31

1453
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:59,230
make sure that you do that and just stay

1454
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:02,059
safe mm-hmm

1455
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:04,609
