going to have a lot of fun tonight

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,869
because we are celebrating kind

8
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,400
of you know that's the Halloween

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,350

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,429
little something but this time

11
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:18,149
we're doing something a little

12
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:19,260
bit different thanks to the folks

13
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,420
over at Stage 9 what we're doing

14
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,149
is actually taking a virtual reality

15
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,190
tour of the Starship Enterprise

16
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,660
from Star Trek The Next Generation

17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,210
that's 12:43. You want to stick

18
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,379
around. We're going to actually

19
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,229
take Sasha's gaming rig for a spin.

20
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,530
The first time it's ever run again.

21
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,880
We're going to be ranking things

22
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,799
up with the graphics. We're going

23
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,829
to see how she performs as we tour

24
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,20
the Starship Enterprise.That is

25
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:47,909
awesome. And here's what's coming

26
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:49,899
up in the category 5 TV newsroom.

27
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,289
A bot net of unknown intent has

28
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,640
been discovered and is spreading

29
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,590
at a frightening rate. Google's

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,649
Project Loon has brought some internet

31
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,520

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,100

33

hopes to succeed where other vendors

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,129
have failed. They want to bring

need to wipe everything and reinstall

40
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,900
Mac OS because a nasty bit of malware

41
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,579
came with the popular software

42
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,159

of all I want to say hello to everyone

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,569
who's new here this week. Of course

68
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,550
we are kind of in Halloween mode.

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,900
Being that it's Halloween week

70
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,669
so it's Friday. Welcome to the

71
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,439
to the holiday week. We're going

72
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,759
to get into that in just a couple

73
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,379
of minutes time. Nice to have you

74
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,330
joining us. We had a discussion

75
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,889
a couple of weeks ago about Star

76
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:45,599
Trek. It was actually Star Trek

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,139
discovery versus the Orrville.

78
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,620
And we keep coming back to this

79
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,719
because it's been a hot topic on

80
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,229
YouTube of course. Boy a lot of

81
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,360
angry trekkies out there. I'll

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,60
tell you what. But one particular

83
00:03:00,60 --> 00:03:01,770
comment really stood out to me.

84
00:03:02,69 --> 00:03:04,50
Do you see that one there.Yes from

85
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:06,629
Razzy 13:12 that's the one. Yes.

86
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,669
Simply put. Imagine if the characters

87
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:09,930
in Oroville and discovery were

88
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,340
substituted with the characters

89
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,780
from any of the Star Trek series

90
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,889
which one fits more.See. So when

91
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,539
you're thinking hey is discovery

92
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:21,180
like Star Trek. It's pretty neat.

93
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,680
You think about Captain Picard

94
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,960
on the Orrville it just works on

95
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,30

96
00:03:27,30 --> 00:03:28,110

you can see and it is time for

148
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:30,579
part 10 of Sasha up build a gaming

149
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:34,899
PC Wednesday. Oh is it.This is

150
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,149
it. This is that main unveiling.

151
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,879
Well we are actually going to game

152
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:45,160
stage dash 9 dot code dot uk. Check

153
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,500
it out. These folks are working

154
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,779
really really hard to recreate

155
00:05:50,79 --> 00:05:52,449
the Starship Enterprise. NCC 17:1

156
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,129
D. From the next generation. Now

157
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,860
so much effort has gone into this

158
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:59,589
using Unreal Engine 4 and it's

159
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,529
literally a tour of the Starship

160
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,199
Enterprise. Now we're using Tonight

161
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,939
we're on Linux and we're using

162
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,360
a pre alpha release. So that means

163
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,740
it's not even alpha yet. It's not

164
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,209
even ready for prime time. We're

165
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,279
probably going to encounter some

166
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,660
glitches we're probably going to

167
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,399
encounter weird things that are

168
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,0
going to be fixed but it's so nice

169
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:23,949
that they're releasing versions

170
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,410
that we can give a try to. First

171
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,300
of all it works on Linux Mac and

172
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,699
Windows. Cool. If you're a Linux

173
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,40
fan like us please get on over

174
00:06:33,40 --> 00:06:35,800
to stage Dash 9 doc cocotte UK

175
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:37,540
make sure you reach out to Rob

176
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,519
there and let them know that you

177
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,709
are a big supporter of stage 9

178
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,569
on Linux because we really want

179
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,430
to see them always bringing out

180
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:46,750
versions for Linux. I know they're

181
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,149
going to do it but they need to

182
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,379
know of course that there is a

183
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,449
Linux gaming community as well

184
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,649
and we want to see how this goes.

185
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,680
So it's a game that we're going

186
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,920
to run on the gaming computer rights

187
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,629
but it's not quite a game yet like

188
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,189
we're not interacting with people

189
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,680
were touring the Starship Enterprise.

190
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,139
This is awesome.You folks ready

191
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,420
get into the chat room Category

192
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,9
5 on Friday and let us know where

193
00:07:12,9 --> 00:07:14,470
you'd like us to go. Now this is

194
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:16,540
what they endeavor to do. Eventually

195
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,399
this is going to be stage 9 is

196
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,29
going to be a full tour of the

197
00:07:22,29 --> 00:07:23,379
enterprise that you can walk through.

198
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,9
That is true to the blueprints.

199
00:07:25,60 --> 00:07:27,550
That is true too. Attention to

200
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,129
detail based on episodes of the

201
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:32,139
show. So when you walk in the rooms

202
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,529
you know décor is what you would

203
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,800
expect it to be. So this is a really

204
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,480
really exciting project folks.

205
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,490
And before we get into it we do

206
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,560
need to say that it is a fan project.

207
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,660

213
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,110
absolutely free and both the project

214
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,470

fan productions that are provided

216
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,639
with no monetary compensation.

217
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,970
OK. Ready. Yes. Let's spin the

218
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,910
camera around and hop into the

219
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,379
holodeck. So here we are you ready

220
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:19,689
to take the tour. Chat Room tell

221
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:21,399
us where you want us to go. First

222
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,660
of all we're going to head on up

223
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,399
to the main bridge and see if we

224
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,410
can find our way here. Now of course

225
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,540
we're walking down a corridor on

226
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,70
NZC 17:1 de senior Wences wants

227
00:08:36,70 --> 00:08:40,39
us to go to Ran's corridors Rahm's

228
00:08:40,39 --> 00:08:43,70
corridors. It's an option here

229
00:08:43,70 --> 00:08:44,899
is now we're in a turbo lift and

230
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,399
the way that it is working at this

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,480
point is they've got their destinations

232
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,9
set up on kind of a computer type

233
00:08:52,9 --> 00:08:53,330
screen because it needs to make

234
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,190
sense for us to be able to find

235
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,929
where we're going.So up on deck

236
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:59,509
one we've got the main bridge let's

237
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,769
head on up there we want to see

238
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,480
all the detail that's gone into

239
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,460
that And off we go. We're there.

240
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,889
Anyone else feel that this is like

241
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,440
my boy boyhood fantasy is right

242
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,409
here. What does that tell you about

243
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,309
me. All right let's get to a little

244
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,899
bit of a walk around looking out

245
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,480
here. We've got some destruction

246
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,100
out there. What have we got. Look

247
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,799
at that folks just beautiful attention

248
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,90
to detail. This is incredible.

249
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,600
Aren't going to show you before

250
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,309
we really get into kind of game

251
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:52,129
play and touring the enterprise

252
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,509
let's look at some of the options

253
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,29
that we have here. So first of

254
00:09:56,29 --> 00:09:57,799
all we're on the gaming rig that

255
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,889
has been built on the course of

256
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,909
10 episodes. So let's look at this

257
00:10:05,90 --> 00:10:07,129
low quality setting. So this is

258
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,90
low. Pardon me I didn't hit. OK.

259
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,110
That is not true. There we go.

260
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,750
So that's our low quality setting

261
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,340
which is still pretty fantastic.

262
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,590
But if you've got a poor frame

263
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,519
rate you might you might need that.

264
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:22,370
Now of course Sasha this is the

265
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,19
gaming rig that you've built. We're

266
00:10:24,19 --> 00:10:27,200
going to try epic right. It's just

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,169
really interesting. We're also

268
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,49
going at full 19:20 by 10 A.D.

269
00:10:33,49 --> 00:10:35,509
resolution. We've got everything

270
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,269
just cranked absolutely full. I

271
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,470
turned down the motion blur just

272
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,549
a little bit because I didn't want

273
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,80
you to get dizzy and turned up

274
00:10:42,80 --> 00:10:43,190
the gamma just for the sake of

275
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,720
your TVs because it makes it a

276
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,919
little easier to see things like

277
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,19
the stars.So now that I've done

278
00:10:48,19 --> 00:10:49,279
that now of course there are some

279
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,659
other things I can turn on and

280
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:53,0
PCs. So if you want to see some

281
00:10:54,9 --> 00:10:55,899
some folks on the bridge and throughout

282
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:56,899
the enterprise you can actually

283
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,120
turn them on. They are not presently

284
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,889
interactive but they are kind of

285
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:02,750
cool but they can sometimes get

286
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,919
in the way. So we're going to turn

287
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,519
those guys off and let's restart

288
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,320
and take this right to what you're

289
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,570
going to see when you first connect

290
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:13,820
to stage 9. Here we are in the

291
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,299
turbo lift outside of the main

292
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:20,950
bridge and you'll see that when

293
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,269
you restart it actually resets

294
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:23,559
a couple of the settings I get

295
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,970
turned off and we're going to turn

296
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,129
on animated L cars which apparently

297
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,690
has a performance hit because of

298
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,899
the way that it's done right now.

299
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,309
But it performs well on your system

300
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,929
Sanish. Very cool. All right so

301
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,340
let's head on over here. We're

302
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,169
going to see what what was out

303
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:43,120
there originally before I did a

304
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,440
little bit of play before the show.

305
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:48,700
Look at that. That's deep space

306
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,740
nine folks. So we know where we

307
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,779
are. That must be bage or. That's

308
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:55,809
what I was going to say. Where's

309
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:57,879
the wormhole. OK so let's head

310
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:00,759
up here. So you get some of the

311
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,70
interactivity that you would from

312
00:12:03,70 --> 00:12:07,210
a game. We can. Oh dear do I do

313
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:19,950
it do it do I do it. No.Should

314
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,200
never happen. Who is the joker

315
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,429
who made it so that the only thing

316
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,950
you can blow up is D.S. nine. Come

317
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,809
on. Should have been a Ranjeet

318
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,279
crews are out there or something

319
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:33,639
Romulans. All right let's take

320
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,879
it to folks. The captain's ready

321
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:44,669
room here. So you're watching category

322
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,740
five technology TV. And tonight

323
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,899
we are actually taking a tour of

324
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,529
NZC 12:43 D. This is the Enterprise

325
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,149
from Star Trek The Next Generation.

326
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:56,429
And it is powered by stage nine

327
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,899
and you get it. It's a free download

328
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,190
at stage dash 9. Dom Kotok UK there's

329
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,269
the captain's fish. Cool. Not yet

330
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,669
animated it looks like but cool

331
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,39
again. Great attention to detail.

332
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,250
Looks just like the show. It's

333
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,340
such an incredible job on this

334
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,620
show. All right folks let's see

335
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,0
where the turbo lift can take us.

336
00:13:23,9 --> 00:13:25,200
All right so we've got deck two

337
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,940
is the starboard bow with data's

338
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,860
quarters wharfs quarters cargo

339
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,590
elevator escape pods and a crew

340
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,860
lounge. We've got deck 6 mid-ship

341
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,899
is the transporter room. The science

342
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,0
lab deck seven is the stern with

343
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:41,340
the arboretum deck 8 is the battle

344
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,769
bridge and we've got stellar cartography

345
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,139
on deck 9. Captain Picard's quarters

346
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,340
on deck 8. The computer core look

347
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,539
at all these shuttles made to and

348
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,580
the brig and the sell store and

349
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,379
the cell control which is the warp

350
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,690
engine control going to give us

351
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,820
some of their main engineering

352
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,460
10 forward and holiday. We've already

353
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,509
been to the Halid X you know what

354
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:09,759
I would love to see Main Engineering

355
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,950
that somewhere that Jordi and data

356
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,730
spent a lot of timeAnd just love.

357
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,139
Let's see what we can find here.

358
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,960
Now you'll see these force fields

359
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,409
through the night and that simply

360
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:24,789
means that they haven't completed

361
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:26,590
that area yet. So you can't go

362
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,889
there. Cool. Nice way to get to

363
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:31,330
do it. And the corridors just look

364
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:34,179
absolutely incredible geology lab.

365
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,509
And here we are ladies and gentlemen

366
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,9
main engineering of the Starship

367
00:14:39,70 --> 00:15:01,570
Enterprise you keep hearing pupils

368
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:05,679
get goosebumps. It's rare that

369
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,820
we get a chance to do this kind

370
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,480
of thing on Category 5 technology

371
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,389
but being our Halloween special

372
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,220
hey it felt right. So the tour

373
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,309
will lift over here now. When a

374
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,509
door doesn't open it means that

375
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:17,799
it's not part of the network or

376
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,539
it hasn't been completed yet. So

377
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:20,769
you find the doors that have been

378
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,809
completed and eventually this project

379
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:25,570
is going to have an entire representation

380
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,950
of the star. Where would you like

381
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,39
to go. Let's go to the sick bay.

382
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,129
All right let's turn to on deck

383
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:42,879
12 handicap How much of your day

384
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,559
today did you spend touring around

385
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,610
me.It was more like plugging in

386
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,49
cables and making sure things were

387
00:15:50,49 --> 00:15:54,490
going to work. OK so it looks like

388
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,360
the only way we can go is forward

389
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,330
right now this again is true to

390
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,240
the blueprints of the enterprise

391
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,470
so if you're really focused on

392
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,419
episodes of Star Trek The Next

393
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,279
Generation you're really going

394
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,629
to have a sense that wow they've

395
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,639
they've turned the set intoNatural

396
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,659
interactive environment. Just amazing.

397
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,370
So here we are in sick bay folks.

398
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,309
Now let's head on over to Beverley's

399
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:36,59
office. Here we are. I think we

400
00:16:36,59 --> 00:16:40,620
can sit down if we click yes. There

401
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:48,720
we go. No way. Unreal engine for

402
00:16:51,179 --> 00:17:04,59
beautifulGet go down there. Here

403
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,769
we go feeling one of the weirdest

404
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:09,0
dreams tonight. The best dream.

405
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,720
Where to next.Let's check out now.

406
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:18,490
I'm very interested in the arboretum

407
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,680
and Stellar Cartography. OK let's

408
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,940
head on over to the arboretum which

409
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,9
would be kind of like a garden

410
00:17:24,99 --> 00:17:27,160
on the ship which would be Pretty

411
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,650
cool. Nice place to go read a book

412
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:39,490
or something. Beautiful artificial

413
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:46,99
sunlight. Now I'm looking at this

414
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,710
and I'm wondering what kind of

415
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,630
settings we're currentlyJust all

416
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,769
you weren't asking.Oh my goodness

417
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,9
folks if you thought it was incredible

418
00:17:59,9 --> 00:18:03,599
before now it's just truly epic.

419
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,269
Wow. Holy cow I want to go back

420
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:12,329
and start over. This is just gorgeous.

421
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,480
I was like that's beautiful anyways.

422
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:20,430
But look at that. Oh wow.It's very

423
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:21,720
one of the things that they do

424
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,759
need to implement is like saving

425
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:26,99
of settings I think would be quite

426
00:18:26,99 --> 00:18:27,509
helpful let's you know what can

427
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:30,509
I head back to Main Engineering

428
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,789
just to see what that looks like.

429
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,839
I'll certainly be proud Because

430
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:45,859
that's kind of a big deal. Right.

431
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:47,920
You'll learn your way around. OK

432
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,710
now we've got all. Was that a lens

433
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:58,880
flare. Wow. Sasha I thought this

434
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,579
was impressive. A few moments ago

435
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,819
here now look at this. So if you've

436
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:06,490
got the horsepower folks we've

437
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,750
got lighting effects and balloons

438
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,299
and things like that see. Just

439
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:19,869
awesome. Wow. All right. Let's

440
00:19:20,79 --> 00:19:21,609
let's take the tour. Keep going.

441
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:25,119
Make sure you're in the chat room

442
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,529
Sasha and I are watching as best

443
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:28,930
we can to see where you'd like

444
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,849
us to go. What would you like us

445
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:33,430
to do next. Let's go over to stellar

446
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,589
cartography and see what things

447
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:39,730
look like over there.I'm just mesmerized

448
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,170
by that. It's incredible.I feel

449
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,730
like I've been here like it's a

450
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,829
deja vu feeling having watched

451
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:49,839
so many episodes of Star Trek The

452
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,109
Next Generation. So it kind of

453
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,349
feels like this is like living

454
00:19:56,349 --> 00:20:00,519
the fantasy or the dream of what

455
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,869
Star Trek has created.So we've

456
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,430
got to find the right door because

457
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,579
only the doors that are in active

458
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:10,809
rooms are going to actually let

459
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:20,880
us in. Oh oh now don't fall off.

460
00:20:28,69 --> 00:20:29,690
This looks like from generations

461
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,990
cool it looks like a bit of a work

462
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,700
in progress. Absolutely beautiful

463
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,160
though the textures there. This

464
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,279
looks awesome. All right now where's

465
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:49,59
the trouble. There is an emergency

466
00:20:49,59 --> 00:20:50,650
transport feature so if you get

467
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,809
lost you can actually use emergency

468
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:55,59
transport or if you get outside

469
00:20:55,59 --> 00:20:56,410
and you know of the enterprise

470
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,490
and you can't find your way back

471
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,490
in through a glitch or through

472
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,589
jumping out a shuttle bay or something

473
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:06,549
like that. Speaking of shuttle

474
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,349
bay do we want to check it out.

475
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:18,299
Yes let's. And we're off see how

476
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,950
the door opened but didn't open.

477
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,500
That's like one of those kind of

478
00:21:23,69 --> 00:21:24,750
pre-alpha glitches.You just back

479
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,890
up and go go back again. Oh brigge

480
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,420
nice. Muffie them lower the force

481
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,609
field or not. I don't know how

482
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:37,200
interactive things are just yet.

483
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:39,150
It's more just for the tour of

484
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:52,519
it than anything. Awesome. Looks

485
00:21:52,519 --> 00:22:03,109
like to me no way oh oh. I'll talk

486
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:07,160
to you. You're on my way. Nuclear

487
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,400
waste wherever it ends. OK let's

488
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,430
see what we can do. Open. Source.

489
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:27,309
It's I think this force field generators

490
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:37,410
are there. Wow oh now I'm wish

491
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,599
I didn't blow up the last night

492
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,660
because we go and explore it. Oh

493
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,140
sorry. Bad advice bad advice. Shoot

494
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,579
it. It's fine. Yeah. Let's see

495
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,289
if we can actually operate a shuttlecraft.

496
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:03,730
Can you open me right clicking

497
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,230
and left clicking on the pad. Hoping

498
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:18,910
that that'll do it. Oh. Oh yeah

499
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,660
you did it.Sweet I think once the

500
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,890
PC model is part of my person it

501
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,150
might be a little bit easier to

502
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,549
to see things like where my hand

503
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:33,980
is actually pointed because I'm

504
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,799
just aiming into space and hoping

505
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,569
that I'm pushing in the right spot.

506
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,140
There we go. All right. Take it

507
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:52,839
for a drive. How do we maneuver.

508
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,920
W's not going. Up. There it is.

509
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,410
OK w after a press space. This.

510
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,519
All by themselves it sounds. See

511
00:24:09,59 --> 00:24:21,940
you. As. Like There it is very

512
00:24:22,59 --> 00:24:28,809
cool.Wow. Now we still in epic

513
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:34,130
mode. To correct the system. I

514
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,640
just want to be absolutely sure.

515
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,579
There it is folks the Starship

516
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:42,730
Enterprise as per stage 9 So we're

517
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,500
taking off from a shuttle bay in

518
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,210
a shuttle and it's true to where

519
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,730
the shuttle may be located. There's

520
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,940
the bridge up at the top there.

521
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:58,119
Nice Get on over to stage Dash

522
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:01,150
9 dog Codein. Uk if you'd like

523
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:09,119
to check it out. Let's see if we

524
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,420
can find the shuttle the. There

525
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:22,140
it is. Can i Dockett Coming in

526
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,849
a little fast there Lieutenant

527
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:39,569
Robbie.Ice the job X X you know

528
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,329
how do I up. There we go Right-Click

529
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:49,279
to stand up. You open the door.

530
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,79
Now we're stuck in here forever

531
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:55,39
forever. You can always just press

532
00:25:55,39 --> 00:25:57,170
restart if you're stuck and it

533
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,660
can sometimes happen. Or you can

534
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,430
try the emergency transporter which

535
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,130
is in game and your game menu which

536
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,119
is accessed by the escape key.

537
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:15,509
The. However sometimesIt works

538
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:17,329
beautifully. Look at that. Sometimes

539
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:18,980
the emergency transporter will

540
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,299
take you and place you somewhere

541
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:21,450
you don't want to be in accord

542
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,509
or where there's no escape. Things

543
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:28,220
like that. And we've got time for

544
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,470
one more location so chat room.

545
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,140
Tell Sasha where you'd like us

546
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:40,430
to go.But see here you do. Let's

547
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:46,549
go to ten forward as a 10 forward

548
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,470
is not what's being said. Yes.

549
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,930
Lynden Ten Forward. All right Linda

claims security is Checkpoint on

658
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:45,930
Thursday. At first it was assumed

659
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,970
the malware the malware that was

660
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,339
infected gizmo that infected gizmo's

661
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,200
to form this latest Army was a

662
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,829
variant of the Myrrha I bought

663
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,319
it. That took over hundreds of

664
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,700
thousands of Internet connected

665
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,329
equipment in 2016. However security

666
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:02,309
researchers now think it's actually

667
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:04,349
another family of malicious software.

668
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,79
There's no word yet on what exactly

669
00:32:07,79 --> 00:32:08,849
the botnet will be used for either

670
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:11,39
the reaper malware is spreading

671
00:32:11,39 --> 00:32:12,750
globally by exploiting various

672
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,789
vulnerabilities and embedded devices

673
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,710
such as C-v dashed 20:17 dash 80

674
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,210
to 25 to steal and use the use

675
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,250
and use the usernames and passwords

676
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,440
of the gadgets web based control

677
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,420
panels. Ultimately to commandeer

678
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,690
them for example one of the bot

679
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,839
nets drones a hacked camera running

680
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:34,380
a go ahead embedded web server

681
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,769
on TCAP port 80 one had system

682
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,650
dot I and I file that had changed

683
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,779
to include a netcat command that

684
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,950
opened a reverse shell a backdoor.

685
00:32:45,0 --> 00:32:47,460
In other words this gave the reaper

686
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,559
masters the command line to the

687
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,230
device. Once the bought malware

688
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,849
was on the computer it then attempted

689
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:55,349
to infect other equipment on the

690
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,720
internet and he subsequently hacked

691
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,490
device would also cruise up and

692
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,79
down the information superhighway

693
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,170
in search of a more and more vulnerable

694
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,140
gizmo's to hijack. Right now check

695
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,430
to make sure you're not exposing

696
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,19
a vulnerable device to the Internet.

697
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,180
Apply patches if you can. Look

698
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,740
out for suspicious behavior on

699
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,509
your network and take a gadget

700
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:19,410
off line if it's infected. Wow.

701
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,480
OK so my thought is OK what's the

702
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,289
end game in this. Is this like

703
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,960
leading to something where everything

704
00:33:31,49 --> 00:33:32,640
will be in line and then we'll

705
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,269
see a major attack. Once everything

706
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,289
is kind of are you asking me to

707
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:40,519
create a conspiracy theory Right

708
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,869
or like or is it just like an experiment

709
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:44,579
where like perhaps it's very benign.

710
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:46,109
Maybe it's just like let's see

711
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:48,210
what we can do.We've spoken on

712
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,539
the show previously about malicious

713
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,809
software as a form of warfare and

714
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:57,809
we tend to we tend to not quite

715
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:00,930
grasp that as warfare to us is

716
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:03,630
more right. So to think that there

717
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,89
would be cyber warfare. It's really

718
00:34:06,89 --> 00:34:07,920
really hard to get our heads around.

719
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,130
So when you talk about an infection

720
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,289
of this scale. So answer. These

721
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:14,579
are Internet connected devices

722
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,550
so home routers and cameras and

723
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,380
things like that that have internet

724
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,289
connectivity apps and don't feel

725
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:24,30
like everything now has Internet.

726
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,650
You know that really does. Yeah.

727
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,599
The Internet where if the devices

728
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,989
are exploited now you've got thousands

729
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,420
potentially millions of devices

730
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,429
that create. You've heard the term

731
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:38,610
bought it. So let's you know when

732
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,10
we hear botnet we think OK well

733
00:34:40,19 --> 00:34:41,400
that's some kind of virus or some

734
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,929
kind of malware Well it's not exactly

735
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:45,599
like that. Think about a supercomputer

736
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,449
right now. What is a supercomputer.

737
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,909
It's basically thousands of individual

738
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,590
computers connected together and

739
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,409
created to be one super computer.

740
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:58,320
So there's the power of thousands

741
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,789
of other computers all connected

742
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:02,99
together to give the power of one

743
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:04,349
supercomputer. OK. So with the

744
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:06,420
internet of things being compromised

745
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,0
in this particular manner. Now

746
00:35:09,90 --> 00:35:10,500
all of these modems and all of

747
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,849
these cameras and all of these

748
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:13,590
devices that are Internet connected

749
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,110
we've heard about in the news previously

750
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:18,690
even pop machines at colleges are

751
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,70
Internet connected so that they

752
00:35:20,70 --> 00:35:21,900
can update things and change things

753
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:24,300
right remotely. And they were compromised

754
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,730
as well in a in a different attack.

755
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,889
So now they become part of the

756
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:31,710
bought that part of the super computer.

757
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,340
So why does a malicious person

758
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:38,760
or group of people create a supercomputer.

759
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,90
It's to be able to process astronomical

760
00:35:42,90 --> 00:35:46,199
amounts of data at unfathomable

761
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,199
rates. Right. So in legitimate

762
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:51,809
business that's done by creating

763
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:56,99
supercomputers creating it in spot

764
00:35:56,99 --> 00:35:58,110
and that's in a manner of speaking

765
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:00,590
creating legitimate supercomputers.

766
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,130
That's what Google has That's what

767
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,659
Amazon has That's what Facebook

768
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:05,619
has. They've got supercomputers.

769
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,940
So this is not a legitimate means

770
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,190
of doing it. This is a malicious

771
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,250
way of somebody who knows who creating

772
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,70
a supercomputer is it to find a

773
00:36:17,70 --> 00:36:18,780
cure for cancer. Probably not.

774
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,880
It's not like a college experiment

775
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,869
perhaps.Not likely. I mean it could

776
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:26,760
be what that particular college

777
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,900
student when they handed in their

778
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,480
thesis is going to jail. So it's

779
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,219
not a wise thing. Right. Heard

780
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:33,599
of stories like that where someone

781
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:35,130
thinks they're going to figure

782
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,480
out something in security and they

783
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,699
end up going to jail. So that's

784
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:41,730
that is pretty unlikely.So the

785
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,110
only way to protect yourself is

786
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,599
to take your devices off line and

787
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,179
keep them off line. Not necessarily.

788
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,99
Now these particular kinds of exploits

789
00:36:50,99 --> 00:36:53,369
happened because of back doors

790
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:55,260
in the systems in particular things

791
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,210
like leaving the password default

792
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:01,800
like one one one 1 like every password

793
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,360
as well when your internet service

794
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,800
provider shows up and installs

795
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,150
your internet at your new house.

796
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,590
They give you a modem and they

797
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,909
say here's the password for the

798
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:10,630
Wi-Fi and you put it in your phone.

799
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,590
Now you've got internet and it

800
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,10
works. So you're happy. But what

801
00:37:14,10 --> 00:37:15,389
you're not realizing is that that

802
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:17,550
device you're using the default

803
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,980
password the service provider has

804
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,599
that password. Other people have

805
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,70
that password and that password

806
00:37:23,70 --> 00:37:24,750
is quite easily compromised as

807
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,670
well. So that's one particular

808
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,199
instance of a device that has a

809
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,309
default password. You think about

810
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:30,389
the internet of things you've got

811
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:32,369
a toaster that is Internet connected

812
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:34,380
for some crazy reason. Right. Because

813
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,690
this exists it matches a fridge

814
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,889
makes sense. I mean you can put

815
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:38,969
your shopping list on the fridge

816
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:40,710
and you can and it's Internet connected.

817
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:42,420
My toothbrush talks to my phone.

818
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,429
There you go. So these Internet

819
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,170
connected devices. Do you ever

820
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,550
think to change the password on

821
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,659
your fridge. Thinking someone is

822
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:49,920
going to compromise it. Right.

823
00:37:50,99 --> 00:37:51,539
We don't really clue into that

824
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,699
until now somebody through the

825
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:55,590
Internet has gotten through the

826
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,940
default passwords and things like

827
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,650
that. Right. Sometimes changes

828
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,969
the passwords so you no longer

829
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:03,840
have access.And then you're part

830
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,119
of this botnet which is quite potentially

831
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,489
to be used for cyber warfare which

832
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:12,250
is a bad thing. Wow. Yeah. Things

833
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,440
will change your password change

834
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,900
your password change your passwords

835
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,50
and if you if you think you've

836
00:38:16,50 --> 00:38:17,849
been compromised you may have to

837
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,280
wipe the device and start over

838
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,369
with a fresh firmware. That's that's

839
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,719
just the nature of it. Wow. Thank

840
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,440
you. All right. Mobile phone data

841
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,349
services have been boosted in blacked

842
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:36,360
out areas of hurricane hit Puerto

843
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,340
Rico by balloons that were provided

844
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,769
by Google's parent company alphabet

845
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:43,349
Project Loon devices beam signals

846
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:45,119
between each other and to users

847
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,579
on the ground. This extends communication

848
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,380
networks and places where infrastructure

849
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,179
is scarce or has been damaged.

850
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:53,219
The balloons will allow residents

851
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:55,440
with LTE phones to send and receive

852
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,210
text messages and access the web.

853
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,219
However much of the country is

854
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:00,599
still without electricity and more

855
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,10
than a quarter of the population

856
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,920
lacks safe drinking water. Alister

857
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,659
Wesker head of surgical loon said

858
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:08,70
this is the first time we've used

859
00:39:08,70 --> 00:39:09,840
our new machine learning powered

860
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:12,420
algorithms to keep balloons clustered

861
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,130
over Puerto Rico. So we're still

862
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,530
learning how to best do this. As

863
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,989
we get more familiar with the constantly

864
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,849
shifting winds in this region we

865
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:22,230
hope to keep the balloons over

866
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,789
areas where connectivity is needed

867
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:27,360
for as long as possible. So these

868
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,980
balloons are powered by a high

869
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,750
brightness a manner of speaking.

870
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:34,440
So you think about a hot air balloon

871
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,630
it can only go up or down but you

872
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,340
go up or down in order to control

873
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,530
its horizontal movement as well

874
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,90
because you can follow wind drifts

875
00:39:42,90 --> 00:39:44,789
and things like that. So by monitoring

876
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,250
the air flow by monitoring conditions

877
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,170
the artificial intelligence if

878
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,670
you will it's machine learning

879
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,39
is essentially what it is. So it's

880
00:39:53,70 --> 00:39:54,929
pretty simple as far as the algorithms

881
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,30
themselves go but it learns from

882
00:39:57,30 --> 00:39:59,969
its own mistakes. So if it goes

883
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:01,230
up when it should have gone down

884
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,730
it's going to go oh maybe next

885
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,79
time I'll go down when I think

886
00:40:04,79 --> 00:40:05,730
I should go up. And so it learns

887
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,190
and it evolves and it becomes smarter

888
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,599
in a great way. You know what.

889
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:13,650
Pretty cool stuff. So to have stayed

890
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:16,679
over. Now their first test flight

891
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,820
at Alpha that or X was a little

892
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,289
while ago and stayed up. For three

893
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,539
months. A little over three miles.

894
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,99
Wow. Without men controlling it.

895
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:31,59
Like right sort of person controlling

896
00:40:31,59 --> 00:40:33,869
it. So it's pretty cool.Nice. Now

897
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,389
what's what does the LTTE mean

898
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,739
like if your phone didn't have

899
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:40,139
LTE. It's just the great of the

900
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:43,219
service. OK. Fast Internet is LTE

901
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,599
on your phone. OK. So if you if

902
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,820
you have anything less. So basically

903
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:50,880
in a in a war torn place or in

904
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,309
a devastated by Hurricane place

905
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:56,389
like Puerto Rico you'd be looking

906
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:59,360
at high speed Internet on your

907
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,429
phone like we're talking 25 megabits

908
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:04,219
per second on your phone in a place

909
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:05,539
like that provided by a balloon

910
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,610
that's perfect and you can let

911
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,690
people know where you are and that

912
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,599
you're safe. Very cool. My wife

913
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,800
made an interesting point if I

914
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,480
may. Yes. Because I always thought

915
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,579
Oh that's great. They can let people

916
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,380
overseas know if they've got family

917
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,510
and stuff and I made the comment

918
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:22,610
that if we really clicked for me.

919
00:41:23,0 --> 00:41:24,650
But they can now communicate with

920
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,699
one another. Well the infrastructure

921
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:29,119
is there now to communicate with

922
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,619
people in the same town and be

923
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:32,869
able to reach out and say you know

924
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:33,880
how are you doing. Or you know

925
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,989
do you need me to bring anything

926
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:37,309
or whatever else. I mean phones

927
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:39,230
are the main way to communicate

928
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,730
so well and you've got now you've

929
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,550
got e-mail text phone everything

930
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,889
on LTE. Very cool. Speaking of

931
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:48,739
phones Samsung wants to bring the

932
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,750
full power of desktop Linux to

933
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,630
smartphones the most vile giant

934
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:55,250
announced this week that the Linux

935
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,559
on Galaxy project will give smartphones

936
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,659
the capability to run Linux based

937
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,460
distributions on mobile devices.

938
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:04,190
So if you dream of using the smartphone

939
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,929
in your pocket as a desktop Linux

940
00:42:05,929 --> 00:42:07,519
PC you'll be pleased to know that

941
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,949
Samsung clearly shares the same

942
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:12,590
dream Linux on Galaxy will based

943
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,210
on the information currently available

944
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,280
be distributed as an app.It will

945
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,750
be able to run multiple operating

946
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,849
systems likely including a boon

947
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:22,610
to Linux distros run on the exact

948
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,50
same Linux kernel that Android

949
00:42:24,50 --> 00:42:25,789
users and with no virtualization

950
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:27,829
or emulation involved performance

951
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,860
theoretically should be excellent.

952
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,300
But the true power will be unlocked

953
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:35,900
when used with the Samsung daks

954
00:42:36,79 --> 00:42:39,110
desktop dock accessory. This allows

955
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,849
compatible phones to connect to

956
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,860
an external display mouse and keyboard

957
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,50
and other peripherals. The Samsung

958
00:42:45,50 --> 00:42:47,719
Galaxy phone already allows users

959
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,519
to use Android apps with a larger

960
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,10
screen with a desktop style Android

961
00:42:52,10 --> 00:42:55,99
UI. When docs docked with the D

962
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,480
E X bot while Android s is great

963
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,30
as a smartphone and tablet OS it's

964
00:43:02,30 --> 00:43:04,940
not so hot as a desktop one. Sansome

965
00:43:05,59 --> 00:43:07,909
Sam Sung's says its users who want

966
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:09,199
the convenience of their mobile

967
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:11,119
devices but also sometimes need

968
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,739
the tried and true desktop computing

969
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:14,510
environment especially when it

970
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,219
comes to interacting with productivity

971
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,869
tools and entertainment content

972
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,789
that are best viewed on a larger

973
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:22,760
monitor. Linux on Galaxy is still

974
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,409
in the early stages of development.

975
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,239
There's no word on which devices

976
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,329
the initiative plans to support

977
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,79
so I wouldn't suggest rushing out

978
00:43:30,79 --> 00:43:31,849
to buy something Samsung branded

979
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,360
just yet. Motorola Microsoft and

980
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,460
canonical all tried and failed

981
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,349
to bring convergence to the masses.

982
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,840
Can the smartphone giant Samsung

983
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:43,699
succeed where others have failed.

984
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:45,409
Let us know what you think in the

985
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:49,650
comments. Wow. Now why has converge

986
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:51,650
failed if it's failed with all

987
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,329
of the other platforms. Why would

988
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:55,400
Samsung go ahead and pick it up.

989
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:57,199
Yeah why would they start making

990
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,429
something that has already failed

991
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:00,440
by everyone else so you know I

992
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,900
don't have an exact answer to that

993
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,769
I can speculate a little bit. You

994
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:07,699
think about iPhones right. And

995
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:09,820
you think about Android and Google

996
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:11,389
and these are all familiar household

997
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:13,489
names. There's a couple of different

998
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:14,900
things about them. First of all

999
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,949
they've got an app store that is

1000
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:18,170
filled chock full of stuff. So

1001
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,909
you're not going to just switch

1002
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:21,440
phone providers to switch phone

1003
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,929
glasses to a phone that doesn't

1004
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,59
have all the apps that you usually

1005
00:44:26,59 --> 00:44:28,10
use. It just doesn't make any sense

1006
00:44:28,10 --> 00:44:30,710
to you. I know with me when I got

1007
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,570
BlackBerry it didn't make any sense

1008
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,489
because they had disconnected the

1009
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:36,559
Facebook app. There was no Skype.

1010
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:39,19
It just was useless to me. Right.

1011
00:44:39,79 --> 00:44:41,420
So. So that's kind of the same

1012
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,949
kind of scenario I would expect.

1013
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:44,679
The app store would be a big thing

1014
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,739
but also iPhone Android Google

1015
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:52,280
Samsung LG these are all names

1016
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,420
that when you hear them you think

1017
00:44:54,10 --> 00:44:56,30
there are good phones. I know these

1018
00:44:56,30 --> 00:44:57,559
names even if you don't really

1019
00:44:57,559 --> 00:44:58,670
know these names you know these

1020
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:02,239
names. So if Ubuntu Canonical comes

1021
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,829
out with Ubuntu phone and it's

1022
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:06,79
some obscure manufacturer that

1023
00:45:06,79 --> 00:45:08,539
nobody has ever heard of. Right.

1024
00:45:09,19 --> 00:45:10,610
We're not really going to jump

1025
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,650
on the bandwagon and it's so it's

1026
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:13,880
such a shame because they may be

1027
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,300
fantastic phones. Who knows.But

1028
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,880
they need the name Samsung on the

1029
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,70
other hand is one of those names

1030
00:45:22,70 --> 00:45:24,380
that may be able to pull this off

1031
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:26,0
just based on their name alone.

1032
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,10
Right. And maybe enough to dig

1033
00:45:28,10 --> 00:45:29,449
them out of the dirt. Yeah they've

1034
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,579
had a rough time of late. So this

1035
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:32,750
would be a really good way for

1036
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,280
them to get it.They can do it without

1037
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,869
blowing up your docking station

1038
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,300
would be great. So to be clear

1039
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,10
I think I imagine just quickly

1040
00:45:40,39 --> 00:45:41,389
because we're running low on time

1041
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:43,400
take your phone plug it into the

1042
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,809
monitor now your monitor lights

1043
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:46,429
up with the phone display and you've

1044
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:47,719
got your keyboard and mouse and

1045
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,670
it becomes a computer but it's

1046
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,349
got Linux on it so it's not a phone

1047
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:53,300
OS so you're not feeling like you

1048
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,829
know the ones you don't where you've

1049
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:56,760
got to swipe like a tablet connected

1050
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,409
to a screen. It just doesn't make

1051
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:00,630
any sense. Yeah.It turns into a

1052
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,429
desktop operating system sort of

1053
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,780
reminds me of like that Nintendo

1054
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,300
switch ideology a little bit right

1055
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:08,250
where it switches to the big screen

1056
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,269
and then it's ice seamlessly. Wow.

1057
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,460
All right. So it's going to be

1058
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,170
an unpleasant week for some Mac

1059
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,909
users who are facing a complete

1060
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,650
system wipe and reinstall after

1061
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,260
hackers stashed malware in legitimate

1062
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,460
applications. Tim software which

1063
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,769
makes the popular media player

1064
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,530
and download manager has confessed.

1065
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,300
The latest version of these two

1066
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,639
apps came with an welcome extra

1067
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:38,269
the rather horrid horrid OS X.

1068
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,519
Proton malware the bot which was

1069
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:43,320
injected into downloads of the

1070
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,239
applications was spotted by security

1071
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:47,610
shop Isa which alerted Dell Media.

1072
00:46:48,59 --> 00:46:49,800
A subsequent investigation revealed

1073
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,260
miscreant's had got into the developers

1074
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,969
servers implanted the malware into

1075
00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:55,739
the download files and then left

1076
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:57,300
the company in fact its users as

1077
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,639
they fetched the software. Proton

1078
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,39
is a remote control Trojan designed

1079
00:47:02,39 --> 00:47:04,170
specifically for Mac systems. It

1080
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,849
opens a back door granting route

1081
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:08,130
level command line access to commandeer

1082
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,199
the computer and conceal passwords

1083
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:12,869
encryption and VPN keys as well

1084
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:14,639
as crypto currencies from infected

1085
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,730
systems. That's Bitcoin. It can

1086
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,190
even gain access to victims. I

1087
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,920
cloud account regardless of whether

1088
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,539
to factor if education is used

1089
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:28,170
or not. It warns that a total system

1090
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,19
OS reinstall is the only guaranteed

1091
00:47:31,19 --> 00:47:32,519
way to totally rid your system

1092
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,269
of this malware. Wow. So how would

1093
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:37,710
you know if you've been infected.

1094
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,829
That's a good question now. There

1095
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:42,59
is a lot of information out there

1096
00:47:42,59 --> 00:47:46,50
for Mac users. So you know there

1097
00:47:46,50 --> 00:47:47,730
are particular files that this

1098
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,469
Trojan leaves behind on your hard

1099
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:51,570
drive so it makes it fairly obvious

1100
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,920
that you're infected by finding

1101
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,420
these files. Ok off the top of

1102
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,289
my head I don't know what those

1103
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,789
files are but you'll find those

1104
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,280
if you go to any security bulletin

1105
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,99
about this malware bytes is a fantastic

1106
00:48:02,99 --> 00:48:03,659
source and in fact malware bytes

1107
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:06,90
for Mac will not only detect but

1108
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,989
remove residual residue of this

1109
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:12,329
Trojan. Oh I think he said is right

1110
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:14,190
though. Because this thing has

1111
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,50
root level access that means it

1112
00:48:16,50 --> 00:48:17,969
is the super user on your Mac.

1113
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,909
Even Malware Bytes can't guarantee

1114
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:22,230
that it has removed everything

1115
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,429
that's happened because it's a

1116
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:26,429
backdoor so the hackers may have

1117
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:28,110
already remolded into your computer

1118
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,420
and done other things that Malware

1119
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,889
Bytes would have no way to know

1120
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,760
whether or not it.So you would

1121
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,929
be best just to assume that you're

1122
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:39,809
in fact. No no. Find out if you

1123
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:41,909
are by checking for those files

1124
00:48:42,39 --> 00:48:44,409
or an easy peasy way is install

1125
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:46,469
malware bytes for Mac and run a

1126
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:52,170
scan. OK if it detects the. Malware

1127
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,19
then we know that hey we've got

1128
00:48:55,19 --> 00:48:57,750
it. Probably just to be safe. You

1129
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,460
can remove it because of the nature

1130
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,409
of this one. You have no way to

1131
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,570
know whether or not they put other

1132
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,489
things in their rights. That's

1133
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:06,960
the tough thing here. So that's

1134
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,829
why I use that says a system wipe

1135
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:10,920
is the only way to know that you

1136
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,250
are clean from this one infected.

1137
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,409
That's brutal. That is horrible.

1138
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,90
Mac users tend to think that they're

1139
00:49:18,90 --> 00:49:22,530
safe. Of course they do yes. Well

1140
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:25,19

Just helping pick the parts of

1170
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,889
the computer ráby guiding me through

1171
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:45,30
battling it. We've had countless

1172
00:50:45,30 --> 00:50:46,500
lives.I was like don't do that.

1173
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,510
Don't put it there. No.Now now

1174
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,699
that this is over you can watch

1175
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:54,0
the entire series.You can like

1176
00:50:54,0 --> 00:50:57,469
us on Facebook again. Yeah. So

1177
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,909
it's a sweet gaming rig. Let's

1178
00:50:58,909 --> 00:51:00,139
go over a little bit of the hardware

1179
00:51:00,139 --> 00:51:01,190
here just so you know what you're

1180
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,829
getting. You is a seventh gen Intel

1181
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,289
Core desktop. Seven seventy seven

1182
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:07,730
hundred k. It's overclocked is

1183
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:11,780
4.5 gigahertz. It is sweet. The

1184
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,309
motherboard is in the Seuss Republic

1185
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:16,369
of gamer Maximus 8. That's the

1186
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:19,280
hero and it is also sweet. It's

1187
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,860
a gaming motherboard. The cooling

1188
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,10
system is like a Thermaltake contact

1189
00:51:25,10 --> 00:51:27,110
silent 12. Nice and quiet. The

1190
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,159
RAM. This is beautiful Kingston.

1191
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,260
Hyper X fury gaming RAM. Not only

1192
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,199
that but 32 gigabytes of it. The

1193
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:37,909
system can take up to 64 but we

1194
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:39,829
put 32 in there so to be dual channel

1195
00:51:40,50 --> 00:51:41,840
it could be as fast as can be and

1196
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,769
it gives you the chance that if

1197
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,119
you ever need more than that which

1198
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:45,500
I know you're never going to need.

1199
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,690
You can go that route. We've got

1200
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,969
an end to solid state drive which

1201
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:51,619
is a chip on the motherboard that

1202
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:53,210
sash install that's got the operating

1203
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,369
system which is Linux game in the

1204
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,239
can never win that game. The gaming

1205
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:01,519
OS of Linux it's awesome it's very

1206
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,50
it's based on a boom too and it

1207
00:52:03,50 --> 00:52:04,789
works great so that is a Kingston.

1208
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:07,760
Kingston digital 240 gig SSD now

1209
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,39
M.Com to six gigabits per second

1210
00:52:10,50 --> 00:52:12,619
sweet little thing and that's got

1211
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:13,909
your OS but we knew that you'd

1212
00:52:13,909 --> 00:52:15,380
have like family photos videos

1213
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,280
things like that that you're going

1214
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,239
to need to be able to store on

1215
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:19,489
here and and m.com to 240 gigs

1216
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:20,449
is going to fill up pretty quick

1217
00:52:20,449 --> 00:52:21,829
so we stuck a terabyte Kingston

1218
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:23,480
drive in there as well.It's an

1219
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,630
SSD. It's the hyper X savage. So

1220
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,130
that means it's super fast is ready

1221
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,230
for gaming it is screaming for

1222
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,329
you. The GP. This is a killer unit

1223
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,849
that's the graphics processing

1224
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:36,710
unit right. VR ready. It's got

1225
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,300
several HDMI as well as display

1226
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,50
port vr output and a DVD. So it's

1227
00:52:42,50 --> 00:52:43,639
ready for headsets if you ever

1228
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:45,170
want to get into VR gaming things

1229
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,579
like that. In the meantime it will

1230
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:48,260
hook up to your big TV as well.

1231
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,889
That's the GTA x 10 70 overclocked

1232
00:52:51,889 --> 00:52:54,559
edition and that's ready for 4

1233
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,260
K right out of the box. Then we've

1234
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,969
got the power supply is a dreamy

1235
00:52:59,10 --> 00:53:02,360
Corsair RMX 850 X. It's an 850

1236
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,309
watt power supply fully modular

1237
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:05,550
so the cables are nice unhidden

1238
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,920
you don't you don't see any extra

1239
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,719
cables there. The chassis is this

1240
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,360
beautiful Thermaltake versus the

1241
00:53:10,369 --> 00:53:12,769
22 Black Edition. It lights up

1242
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:14,329
you can change the colors whatever

1243
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:17,630
you want to do then keyboard mouse

1244
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,159
you've got a wireless gaming keyboard

1245
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:21,409
a mouse that's pretty sweet. Then

1246
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:24,300
we've got. That's it. That's how

1247
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,670
it's going to get right. Yeah I

1248
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,869
mean you don't need to mention

1249
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:28,880
Arctic Silver.That's right. Boring

1250
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,829
stuff with that little paste stuff.

1251
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:32,719
Yeah yeah yeah. And we glued a

1252
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:34,940
thing on nothing.So the final thing

1253
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:36,920
we need to know what you're going

1254
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,119
to plug this into when you take

1255
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:39,679
it home. So like do you have a

1256
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:41,0
power bar or something like that.

1257
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,119
Yes. Yeah it's it's like a surge

1258
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:45,940
protector power bartering like

1259
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,230
bar like in words when you bought

1260
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,250
it you didn't really know what

1261
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,599
you were looking for it just had

1262
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:51,980
enough outlets to plug your TV

1263
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,110
in.Yeah yeah. OK so that's why

1264
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,570
Category 5. And viewers of Category

1265
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,239
5 come together to get you a Cyberpower

1266
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:04,130
CPE 1000 AVR U.P.S.. So this is

1267
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,869
a battery backup that you can hook

1268
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:08,59
up your new computer to it. Also

1269
00:54:08,59 --> 00:54:10,579
you can plug your TV into it as

1270
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:13,670
well. This has five battery backup

1271
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,409
ports and nine surge protected

1272
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:17,179
ports. It's guaranteed that it

1273
00:54:17,179 --> 00:54:18,929
will protect your data your fire

1274
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:21,380
your hardware. I should say from

1275
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,980
lightning and surge protection

1276
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,789
and it's got the LCD it's got auto

1277
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:28,70
shutdown software all the works.

1278
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,590
And I got one that was nice and

1279
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,920
small even though it's a thousand

1280
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,409
