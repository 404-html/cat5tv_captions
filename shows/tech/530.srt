00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
welcome to category five technology TV

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,029
it's episode number 530 and we're

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,340
looking forward to a great show tonight

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,650
now we've got viewer questions comments

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,049
that you've sent in through our email on

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,370
Facebook and YouTube and we're really

7
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,310
looking forward to diving into that

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,650
mailbag we love receiving those from you

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,170
also we've got a really cool device here

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,210
that is going to convert any air

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,130
conditioning unit that has a remote

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,810
control so this is like the window air

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,390
conditioner or the one that's mounted on

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,000
the wall in your house it's not a smart

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,610
AC unit it's not able to be connected to

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,250
things like smart thermostats but what

17
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,540
this device will do is it will turn it

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,940
into a smart device by becoming a

19
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,289
wireless app connected remote control

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,030
for you it's called sensible sky where

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,340
you'll be looking at at that in just a

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,440

111

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:48,870
computer build on cat so absolutely send

113
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,370
us an email very good very good okay so

114
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,100
you're gaming computers have been going

115
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,229
pretty good I heard some rumor that Dave

116
00:04:53,100 --> 00:05:00,270
is struggling with Linux and that's okay

117
00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:03,390
he is it's hard for him I think hard for

118
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,650
any of us yeah and and I to be honest

119
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,710
I'm like I'm a little bit like

120
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:11,130
rah-rah-rah Linux without really knowing

121
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,020
what it takes in in full capacity

122
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,990
because I always have Robbie to fall

123
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,280
back on right but then it's a little bit

124
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,700
different for Dave who wants to do

125
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,830
things kind of as much as he can solo

126
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,200
Dave being her husband whoo-hoo we built

127
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,390
a well Sascha built at gaming rig for

128
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,669
but we put Linux on there and if you're

129
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,110
curious about Linux it is an open source

130
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,000
operating system it's an alternative to

131
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,760
Microsoft Windows it's fantastic but it

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,410
is a real leap in order to just jump

133
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,380
into that when you're used to Microsoft

134
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:43,080
Windows or Mac OS or whatever else now

135
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,360
I'm in the same boat because as you

136
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,320
remember Microsoft Windows 10 update

137
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,530
broke my laptop so it's a nice i7 laptop

138
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,550
but the update itself broke my laptop it

139
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,360
won't turn on anymore

140
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,000
so what do I do I kind of bit the bullet

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,140
and said you know what forget this

142
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,690
windows broke it I don't want Windows

143
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,030
anymore and so I put boom 2 on there

144
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,860
17-point 10 so the latest version not

145
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,750
the long-term support edition but the

146
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:14,010
one that is going to roll into the next

147
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:17,730
LTS in April but it is tough even for me

148
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,920
because I'm having to relearn how I am

149
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,020
used to doing things on Windows and and

150
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,270
it's not a real huge learning curve but

151
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,540
hey CyberLink PowerDirector the software

152
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,490
I use to produce the shows it doesn't

153
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,250
work on Linux it's a Windows only

154
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,530
program so that's a real tough thing for

155
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,050
me and so I can see if yeah if you're

156
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,750
used to playing games on Windows and you

157
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,590
run an exe or an MSI file and that's how

158
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,080
you do it

159
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,210
you're not it's really tough to get your

160
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,980
head around the difference it'll change

161
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,170
and then maybe having to use an

162
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,960
alternative so so I'm in that boat right

163
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:55,470
now so I'm looking at blender blender is

164
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,380
used for 3d video production really cool

165
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,060
stuff like you know you see cartoons

166
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,340
like think about Shrek and the way that

167
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,930
that looks I don't know what software

168
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,750
they use probably Maya or something like

169
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,760
that but that kind of video production

170
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,190
but it also has a video editor built in

171
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,690
and I love it but I'm having some you

172
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,540
know there are some quirky things about

173
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,460
it that I don't like and that may be my

174
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,670
mindset being used to Windows and I'm

175
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,920
trying to learn the different way so I

176
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,140
can absolutely empathize with Dave and

177
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,080
those of you who are trying to take that

178
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:31,460
leap entirely into Linux but the cool

179
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,810
thing Sasha is that Dave can install

180
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,570
Microsoft Windows on that computer in

181
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,160
what's called a dual boot environment so

182
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,900
if you're like yeah so if you're not

183
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,050
quite ready if you're not

184
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,930
I mean Linux is fantastic for everything

185
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,550
like surfing the web and doing your game

186
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,840
and stuff but if you're having trouble

187
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:54,390
with one particular thing like in my

188
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:56,100
case video production right I may boot

189
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,930
into Windows and then when I'm done

190
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,670
doing my video production I can reboot

191
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,410
and go back into Linux and use that for

192
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,420
everything else okay so in Dave's case

193
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,820
you might want to do that and install

194
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,520
those windows games right exactly but

195
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,320
then it comes with the caveat that yeah

196
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,500
I had a dual boot on my laptop and

197
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,140
Windows Update destroyed everything it

198
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,820
broke it so

199
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,160
have an image of your hard drive have a

200
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,560
backup be ready for it because it may

201
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,570
happen doesn't always happen but hey

202
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,430
Windows doesn't care about the fact that

203
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,710
your dual booting they just run their

204
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,290
update anyways and and overwrite stuff

205
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,690
so so you do have to watch out for that

206
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,190
be ready for it be careful yeah that's

207
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,530
the only kind of warning I would give

208
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,420
you I guess I mean it's better to do a

209
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,220
boot than it is to just switch over to

210
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:44,660
Windows for me I'm like stubborn shoes

211
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:47,360
resisting it right like I really want to

212
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:51,680
have Linux in the house like that's my

213
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:55,190
that's what this is for Dave but also

214
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,080
yeah like it's a big leap yeah it's a

215
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,250
big huge leap and it's funny it's like

216
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,780
just little things cuz he loves it

217
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,240
eighty-three percent and then the rest

218
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,490
of it he's just like oh I kind of want

219
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,050
Windows yeah yeah when you're used to

220
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,170
certain way of doing things absolutely

221
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,130
it's a dual boot maybe the answer what

222
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,340
do you folks think what is your

223
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:19,340
experience been what do you suggest that

224
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,650
that's ashland dave and other and

225
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,390
viewers in particular who are thinking

226
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,130
about experimenting with linux and and

227
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,350
trying that operating system out on

228
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,210
their computer if you're not sure what

229
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,620
we're even talking about you're not you

230
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,720
don't know what linux says head on over

231
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,040
to Boone to calm and I say that like as

232
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,500
if I expect you to know how to spell it

233
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,870
it's you be UN tu calm it's a South

234
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:45,200
African word it means the spirit of

235
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,670
community in unity and it is a Linux

236
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,050
operating system a free operating system

237
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,690
that you can install and try on your

238
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,730
computer and it replaces the need for

239
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,770
Microsoft Windows but again if you're

240
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,330
using particular applications it can be

241
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,550
a bit of a learning curve or having to

242
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,520
use alternates if you use your computer

243
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,990
specifically for internet and more and

244
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,900
more progressively these days it's like

245
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,490
you're using Google Docs and online

246
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,670
things that don't actually require

247
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,010
Windows applications to be installed you

248
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,230
can install Chrome on Linux and do all

249
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,390
of your online stuff but it keeps you

250
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,450
safer because we don't have the problems

251
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:23,209
that Windows has with viruses and

252
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,220
malware and things like that so

253
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:28,939
so it's definitely a good thing to look

254
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,350
at so check it out Ubuntu comm Asha

255
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:32,420
we've got to take a really really quick

256
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,089
break and when we come back we've

257
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:38,029
actually got a device that is going to

258
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:42,019
turn your standard air conditioner unit

259
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:43,819
into a smart AC very complete with an

260
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,930
app on your mobile device stick around

261
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:49,279
we're going to show you how to do that

262
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:53,029
coming up whether you shop on ThinkGeek

category 5 technology TV bp9 in the chat

276
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:30,139
room as we're live here on a Wednesday

277
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,230
night says Robbie for a strong machine

278
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:37,209
like Sascha built why not run Windows in

279
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,209
a virtual machine so what

280
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:44,569
okay so virtualization and that system

281
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:46,370
would handle it like a beast is the

282
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:49,160
ability to install another operating

283
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:52,790
system into another operating system so

284
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,730
imagine booting up into a boon - and

285
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,069
then opening windows as if it was a

286
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,050
program on your computer and within

287
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:03,529
windows on your computer you can then do

288
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:06,410
the things that Windows does amazing

289
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:08,540
amazing is that is there any problems

290
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,620
over there like it's a pros cons problem

291
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,319
that you're gonna run is that this is

292
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,939
specifically a gaming rig so being a

293
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:15,649
gaming rig you want the highest frames

294
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:18,500
per second you can get you want to be

295
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,029
able to do the the best most seamless

296
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,970
gaming and you want to have a great

297
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:24,170
gaming experience so in a virtual

298
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,879
machine you're not going to get the same

299
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,009
frame rate that you're gonna get on bare

300
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,620
bones architecture the Windows operating

301
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:32,209
system running on the computer or the

302
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,519
Linux operating system running

303
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,569
as the core OS on the computer so in a

304
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,189
virtual machine you're gonna lose some

305
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:38,749
of that frames per second you're also

306
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,149
going to lose the ability to say just

307
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:43,309
plug in an oculus rift and have it work

308
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:46,939
because remember that it's a virtual

309
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:50,360
machine so how does it emulate an oculus

310
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:52,519
rift in virtualization I don't know I

311
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,829
don't know how that how that trend

312
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,199
translates but keeping in mind that when

313
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:59,660
you plug a device into the computer it's

314
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:03,170
now then piped into the virtual machine

315
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,439
as a virtual device that can affect

316
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,179
performance in gaming especially now in

317
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:11,480
a server environment virtualization is

318
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:14,629
fantastic in an office environment hey I

319
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,540
could probably run my you know if I had

320
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:19,160
a powerful enough laptop which I don't I

321
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,379
could run a virtual machine with

322
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,360
VirtualBox install Windows 7 Windows 10

323
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:25,639
and have CyberLink PowerDirector in

324
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,059
there for all my video editing but I

325
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,800
that requires a lot of power but in a

326
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,459
gaming standpoint I don't know that it

327
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,249
would perform quite as well as we need

328
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:39,589
all right so that's that's great chat

329
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:42,439
room thank you very much nice to see you

330
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:44,299

nice to see ya grab dawn hey nice to see

333
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,040
you yeah Linden all right

334
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,779
and I just kind of just read a couple

335
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,939
names off the top of the list there but

336
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:02,360
now we've got your viewer questions

337
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:03,559
comments we're gonna be tackling at just

338
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,889
in a couple of minutes time just after

339
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:10,639
our are reviewed here but first I want

340
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:12,769
to look at the sensible sky this is cool

341
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,720
because we think about smart devices we

342
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,360
think about the ability to you know I

343
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,689
have a nest thermostat at my house so ok

344
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,660
that means I save money by running a

345
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:24,980
thermostat that intelligently figures

346
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,319
out when I'm home

347
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,749
turns off the AC or the heat at that

348
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,790
time and then when I get home it turns

349
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:33,920
it back on or if I'm if I'm making the

350
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,149
trip home if I'm leaving work and I know

351
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,709
that the house is a little bit cold

352
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,959
because I can bring up the app I can

353
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,639
turn on the heat from my app and then by

354
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,089
the time I get home it's nice and cozy

355
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,100
so sensibo sky takes it kind of to

356
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:48,920
another level because of course

357
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:52,520
nest and smart thermostats like nest

358
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,590
they require a hardwired central air

359
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,140
conditioning unit furnace those kinds of

360
00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:00,410
things it's a hardwired connection

361
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:05,420
sensibo is completely different you want

362
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:09,110
to know so you picture an AC unit that's

363
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:11,690
in your window or like a you know if

364
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,700
you've got a heat exchanger you know

365
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,070
there are all kinds of devices that you

366
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,880
might use but I think in particular of

367
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:22,310
you know the wall hanging AC units not

368
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,470
central air but AC units that use a

369
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,560
remote control yeah right you use a

370
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,510
remote control to adjust the temperature

371
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,380
my AC back in the apartment before we

372
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,550
got central air at the house it had had

373
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,350
a remote control it was just in the

374
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,210
window right it was a great little unit

375
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,370
but you had to be home to adjust it and

376
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,029
there was no intelligence to it

377
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,790
whatsoever

378
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:46,279
so what sensibo does is it's an app

379
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:49,880
connected device through your Wi-Fi and

380
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:52,990
it then allows you to control your AC

381
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,300
unit that has infrared remote control

382
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:59,030
technology you can control it from your

383
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,160
app okay okay so you think about an AC

384
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,720
unit that has a remote control as long

385
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,060
as it has an infrared remote control

386
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,980
sensibo sky is going to be able to

387
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,770
control it so let's get into the box and

388
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,510
actually get a look at what this what

389
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:15,010
this device looks like so here we are

390
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:18,710
this is the box for sensible sky and

391
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:21,140
nice little device let's just get right

392
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,320
into it it's it's so super simple I mean

393
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,330
here's our step-by-step instructions

394
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:30,020
download and install the app follow the

395
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,850
instructions in the app and joy and keep

396
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,280
cool those are your instructions would

397
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:37,850
simple simple so there it is that's the

398
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:40,120
sensible sky as you can see let's get

399
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,380
some of this wrapper off of here

400
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,940
there we go I'll just stick that over

401
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,880
there and we've got a little bit of a

402
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,110
kind of a like a double sided tape kind

403
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,940
of thing going on over here so I can

404
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,980
just stick it to the wall it's also got

405
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:56,420
a mount that I can screw it into the

406
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,220
wall and then here we've got USB micro

407
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,290
input

408
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,840
and what looks like some kind of a data

409
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,820
port I'm not we're not sure on that one

410
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,819
it almost seems like it's maybe a

411
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,620
connection for a connected furnace or

412
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,360
some I don't know what that is we'll

413
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,650
look it up you can look that up as well

414
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,420
I don't think that that's gonna affect

415
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,040
our use of it today might be for

416
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:20,439
firmware updates and things like that as

417
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:23,530
well further in the box how simple is

418
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:26,620
that now it is sensible sky is powered

419
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:29,200
by USB Micro as I mentioned there it's

420
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,300
got just the USB micro jack so it comes

421
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:37,480
with a what looks like a good long USB

422
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:40,450
micro cable oh yeah oh there we go good

423
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,240
length on that anyway so because it's

424
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,560
USB micro it's gonna work anywhere in

425
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,120
the world we don't need to have any

426
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,180
fancy adapters we don't need to have any

427
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,700
anything that's you know extra special

428
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,590
to work overseas or anything like that

429
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,060
now it came with a little power brick

430
00:17:53,590 --> 00:18:00,790
here so that I can plug that in as well

431
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:02,470
the brick that it came with is it's one

432
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,900
amp so it doesn't need a lot of power

433
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,270
most of the bricks that you already have

434
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,550
are going to have 2.4 amps or even

435
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,300
higher so this is you know this can be

436
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:15,940
powered by basically any any little USB

437
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,290
power cable that you have so I'm just

438
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,030
going to simply plug this in like the

439
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,910
instructions say so I'm just gonna plug

440
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:24,460
in the USB and we'll see what happens

441
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,810
here if I can do this kind of blindly

442
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:30,070
there we go

443
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:32,350
and now the sensible logo is just kind

444
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,730
of flash and blue there on occasion so

445
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,160
I'll just kind of set that down there

446
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,980
now I've got this really cool thing on

447
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,910
my phone called miracast and it allows

448
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,070
me to in fact bring up my phone on the

449
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,710
screen for you so I can actually do that

450
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:51,610
so how cool is that so let's bring up

451
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:54,310
the sensibo app there we are and back

452
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:58,210
here so the first thing that I need to

453
00:18:54,310 --> 00:19:00,490
do is select the sensible sky that's the

454
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,380
device that I've purchased and it says

455
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,200
connect your sensibo sky device to the

456
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,780
power outlet which I've done and then

457
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,700
hit next now it says find the QR code

458
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,809
located on the back of your sensible sky

459
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,850
device

460
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:15,220
click Next okay so on the back of my

461
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,080
device sure enough there it is it's itty

462
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,690
bitty is my camera going to be able to

463
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,720
read that let's see okay so now I can

464
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,940
see the camera there let's see it's

465
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,440
choppy but let's see oh it actually did

466
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:35,320
it Wow oh yeah choose an icon and name

467
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:37,690
the AC okay so I I'm gonna say this is

468
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,950
can we call this living room we're just

469
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,960
we're basically pretending because we

470
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,850
don't have an AC unit here at the studio

471
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,659
that we can use with this so we're gonna

472
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:49,600
say living room next and I've left it as

473
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:52,090
the default device allow sensible to

474
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,909
allow this to access this device's

475
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,249
location alright in order to complete

476
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:59,169
the setup sensibo needs to get right

477
00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:04,119
settings permission the permission is

478
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:05,980
needed to check Wi-Fi and after setup is

479
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:09,029
complete you may disable this permission

480
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:12,700
in settings apps configure settings

481
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:14,909
modify system settings so right settings

482
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,440
permission okay we're gonna enable that

483
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:20,259
we're gonna trust that this is all good

484
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,249
because sensibo is a legit company and

485
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:23,499
what do we got here

486
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:26,700
modify system settings does it just let

487
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:32,950
me why is it taking me to other apps

488
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:35,070
cool okay let's go back to sensibo do we

489
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,899
see it oh there we go a living room

490
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:40,289
there we go

491
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:42,580
okay so now I don't have an AC unit

492
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,679
connected to this as I mentioned but you

493
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,909
can see up at the top right-hand side of

494
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,029
the app there do you see that on your

495
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:52,059
screen at the Left we've got humidity

496
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:55,179
levels we've got a temperature gauge as

497
00:20:52,059 --> 00:21:00,999
well and what's neat about sensibo is it

498
00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:03,999
allows us to actually control our AC

499
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:06,789
unit not only the on/off state of the

500
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:08,320
air-conditioner if it's got wireless

501
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,360
remote it's going to be able to control

502
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,450
it but it also allows us to control the

503
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,519
fan setting and it allows us to do that

504
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,619
from anywhere in the world because the

505
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,230
app is connecting to the Internet and

506
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:23,300
the Internet is then communicating back

507
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:29,180
with our sense of oh device and that is

508
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:31,040
is controlled by this app so cool what

509
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,710
does it say okay so please observe the

510
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:39,440
indication LED of this device count the

511
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:43,640
number of blinks okay one one one

512
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,480
okay in order to complete the setup okay

513
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,580
I did that

514
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,810
oh maybe oh that's why it took me here

515
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:54,440
it wants me to turn on oh it needs the

516
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:56,390
right permission okay it allows the app

517
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,520
to read or write system settings it

518
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,870
needs to read those Wi-Fi settings so

519
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,820
this is kind of interesting Sasha

520
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,150
because what I'm reading that is

521
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,130
actually doing here right is it's making

522
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,650
it so I don't have to program the

523
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,660
sensibo with my Wi-Fi settings it's

524
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,120
going to glean those from my phone

525
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,700
settings so now that I've got that set

526
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,000
up here let's go back to the sensibo app

527
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,780
I've turned on the access let's see what

528
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,780
it does differently

529
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:36,519
could not find sensibo device make sure

530
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:38,229
your GPS is turned on your phone

531
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,909
location settings oh and I've learned

532
00:22:38,229 --> 00:22:45,309
I've lost my miracast

533
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:47,019
sorry on just reconnect there for you so

534
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:48,700
this is just kind of the initial setup

535
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:50,440
that you're going to go through it is

536
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,820
pretty you know as you see it's pretty

537
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,629
straightforward it's telling me what I

538
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:58,479
need to do let's retry see if it gives

539
00:22:55,629 --> 00:23:01,029
me a connection this time searching for

540
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:04,179
your sensible device and it looks like

541
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:07,239
it okay to connect your smart AC to the

542
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:09,219
Internet please select ok so sensibo is

543
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:12,399
now detecting all the different Wi-Fi

544
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:14,320
networks and my apparently when it does

545
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:15,700
that it knocks off miracast so that's

546
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,070
why I lose the connection they're going

547
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,940
to try to bring up the screen here again

548
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,039
for you there we go

549
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,200
so it's detected all the local Wi-Fi

550
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,839
hotspots I'm going to tell it which one

551
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,489
is mine and then I need to tell sensible

552
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:32,169
okay what is my password so I'm just

553
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:35,739
going to enter that here mm-hmm

554
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:36,909
I have a really strong password so bear

555
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:42,249
with me here folks

556
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:47,829
I have possibly a it's a simple kind of

557
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:50,379
class password one two three no how does

558
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:53,829
that connect to your actual Wi-Fi or not

559
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:56,619
you're right BAC AC that's what's cool

560
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:59,259
so you think about your AC unit that has

561
00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:03,669
a wireless remote control right it's

562
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:06,700
infrared so as I control sensibo with my

563
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:10,619
phone with the app I'm actually

564
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:14,829
triggering a wireless remote control

565
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:16,719
signal infrared from sensible so okay so

566
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:18,039
then it's it's not like céntimos

567
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:19,749
talking to the remote this talking to

568
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,789
the AC senses correct how could have

569
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:23,889
lost your remote completely since about

570
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:27,009
is the remote absolutely that's correct

571
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:31,329
okay so it's I got it so that's how it's

572
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:32,769
communicating I yeah all right cool okay

573
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:34,899
so I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a go

574
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:39,879
again here what kind of blinks have we

575
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:42,429
got one one okay maybe I entered my

576
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:43,440
password incorrectly let's try again to

577
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:49,139
connect

578
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,909
here we go gonna try one last time never

579
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:54,299
a good idea to talk and type your

580
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:58,919
password at the same time that was all

581
00:24:54,299 --> 00:25:01,980
me oh it's me configuring Oh starting AC

582
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,129
Wi-Fi connection and I've lost miracast

583
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:09,149
but I'll fire that back up for you

584
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:12,029
there we go waiting for sensibo oh and I

585
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:17,250
lost miracast apologies let's bring that

586
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:19,889
back out oh I see what's happening here

587
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,990
Sasha it's connecting direct my phone is

588
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:23,879
connecting directly to sensibo it says

589
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,779
to use miracast disconnect the other

590
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:31,049
Wi-Fi direct connection ah that's why

591
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:32,429
okay so I can't really use miracast at

592
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:35,820
the same time that we're doing this so

593
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:37,860
it's trying it wants to connect through

594
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,740
a Wi-Fi connection it's almost acting

595
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:43,470
like a hotspot so that's kind of cool

596
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,409
okay so now sensibo is connecting to my

597
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,669
Wi-Fi network right I can't bring it up

598
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:49,590
on the screen because as soon as I do

599
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,629
I'm connecting to my Wi-Fi network and

600
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:56,669
then I lose access to the sense of oh

601
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:58,860
that's interesting so essentially that's

602
00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:00,809
all there there is to the setup so you

603
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,549
see that this is flash in a way it's

604
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,740
it's getting the configuration and it's

605
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:07,399
connecting to the network this is now

606
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:10,049
your wireless remote so through your

607
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,639
through your internet connection through

608
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:15,240
the app you're able to control your AC

609
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:17,399
unit all right so then if they're also

610
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,009
like benefits as far as like if you were

611
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:21,419
to leave the house like the phone app

612
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:22,710
does it know that you're leaving yeah

613
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,350
that's what's kind of neat too because

614
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,940
nest does that nest knows that hey if

615
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,190
I've left the house as I mentioned it

616
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,679
start saving me some energy because it's

617
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,259
it knows that I've gone so sensible is

618
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,570
the same thing once my app once my phone

619
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:39,840
is left the Wi-Fi network it knows that

620
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:42,059
I'm no longer there and it and it acts

621
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,039
accordingly so I can program it to say

622
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,960
hey let's turn off the AC unit at that

623
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:50,639
time I feel like they need one of those

624
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:54,119
for my hair streamer I think yeah

625
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:55,379
definitely as a safety precaution so of

626
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,210
course you know setting up something

627
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:59,670
like sensibo here lie

628
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,340
on the TV show is a little bit tricky

629
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,900
and as it goes through the connection

630
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,980
settings and and I'm trying to show it

631
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,750
on the screen at the same time I've

632
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,360
probably monkeyed up a couple things the

633
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,770
setup itself is very easy breezy as you

634
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,810
can see you know the steps are well

635
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,570
defined in the app it shows you

636
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:17,730
everything and it's stable and it tends

637
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,040
to work very very well so give it a look

638
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,350
head on over to cap five dot TV slash

639
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,660
sensibo and you'll be able to pick one

640
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,000
of these up great gift for for under the

641
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,890
tree this year and certainly you know if

642
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,910
you know somebody who has or if you have

643
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:35,120
a an AC unit in your window or in the

644
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,650
house that is controlled by an infrared

645
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,380
controller then this is definitely

646
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,090
something that will be a benefit to you

647
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,730
I love that it turns it into a smart

648
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,110
device it saves us energy and it makes

649
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,450
it so that I can control it from

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,910
oh I apologize that I did have you know

653
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,010
I'm waiting on a couple connection

Technology in general we'd love to

685
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,610
receive that Sasha what

686
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,000
what have we received so far this week

687
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:18,990
well Brittany Murray hey Brittany Murray

688
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,389
has said okay so read the following from

689
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,460
Wikipedia which describes the design

690
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:25,139
intent for the Raspberry Pi so this is

691
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,509
in relation to the Raspberry Pi killer

692
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:30,509
oh yes last week

693
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:32,909
exactly and tell me if you still want to

694
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:35,279
call the Odroid the Raspberry Pi killer

695
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:37,230
the Raspberry Pi is a series of small

696
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,519
single board computers developed in the

697
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,279
United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi

698
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,529
foundation to promote the teaching of

699
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,139
basic computer science in schools in

700
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:48,059
developing countries I just find the

701
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:50,519
term killer to be a poor choice

702
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:53,460
considering the PI's target market and

703
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:56,669
it's a meds user develop a developer

704
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:59,070
hobbyists community should still think

705
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:01,370
that that fits don't get me wrong I love

706
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:04,259
the Odroid and I'll probably order one

707
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:06,600
there's still a bunch of things that we

708
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:09,950
would still be running on PI's in my

709
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,450
house oh sure absolutely and the whole

710
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:14,669
Raspberry Pi killer is a tongue-in-cheek

711
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:17,759
comment Brittany Murray you know that's

712
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:20,100
true and really what it boils down to I

713
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,289
mean it's the power it's the strength of

714
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,379
this thing so if you know if you put

715
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:27,690
David against Goliath you expect Goliath

716
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:29,580
is the the one who's gonna win even

717
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:37,799
though it didn't quite work out that way

718
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:39,299
but in this case no but okay raspberry

719
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,820
pi is a completely different market I

720
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:44,820
look at it this way I want to build

721
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,159
stuff I want to tinker I want to do I

722
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,320
want to build things that do things

723
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,210
that's what the Raspberry Pi is to me

724
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,190
that's what being a maker is to me I

725
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,690
want to be able to develop I want to be

726
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,389
able to try new things I want to be able

727
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,980
to change my mind go back wipe it and

728
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:01,049
start over

729
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,549
so the Raspberry Pi does that and does

730
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:05,070
it well it's perfect for that

731
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:09,120
educational get your feet wet all that

732
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,740
okay now when we as makers get to the

733
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,590
point where the Raspberry Pi is no

734
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,000
longer powerful enough and it is behind

735
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,919
the times you have to admit Brittany

736
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,059
Marie it is behind the times as far as

737
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,879
technology goes because they haven't

738
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:22,560
built a new one in too long and and so

739
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:25,890
the technology has

740
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:29,040
he doesn't do 4k right well I'm not sure

741
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,870
I think it might but but the technology

742
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,910
itself as far as processing power Ram

743
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,560
those kinds of things are far behind at

744
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:39,690
the fact that it has a very very slow

745
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:42,420
USB to controller with a SD card on that

746
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:45,210
controller it's very very slow that way

747
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,190
as far as throughput goes for but it's

748
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,960
great for so many things so don't get me

749
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:52,200
wrong the PI is amazing the pi3

750
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,270
especially but if you're if you get to

751
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,010
that point brittany marie where it's no

752
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,770
longer sufficient power wise and

753
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,690
strength wise and then it's time to

754
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:02,310
bring in goliath and say you know I want

755
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,750
something that's got more power I want

756
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,980
something that's got more RAM I want

757
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,450
something that runs faster I want

758
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,410
something that does away with SD and

759
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:13,260
switches to emmc and has USB 3.0 and

760
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,520
Gigabit Ethernet so so Raspberry Pi

761
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,110
killer know that's that's

762
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,920
tongue-in-cheek because the Raspberry Pi

763
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:22,710
has this place it's a very cheap SBC and

764
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:25,740
it definitely is is good for a lot of

765
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,870
stuff a lot of stuff and does a lot more

766
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,790
than you'd ever expect it to do yeah I

767
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,460
actually I have to raspberry PI's that I

768
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:35,540
use I have one at work that we use just

769
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:38,430
specifically for playing music oh yeah

770
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,740
Lumi oh yeah and then I have one at home

771
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,900
that we use the retro pie like just can

772
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,660
use it for retro gaming like and the

773
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,910
thing is I love them both so much

774
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,760
yeah absolutely there's definitely a

775
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:52,350
place for it yeah but when I want to

776
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,460
build something that has a RAID

777
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:59,340
controller and is able to render 3d

778
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,350
video out of blender in a reasonable

779
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,560
time and has eight cores on its

780
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:06,690
processors yeah you know you know what

781
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,240
you know what I'm saying yeah yeah yeah

782
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,400
picking up what you're laying down there

783
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,170
are other s pcs that are in like I'm

784
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,270
looking at the the fit let to which we

785
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:18,930
were gonna be reviewing coming up and it

786
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:23,070
is so incredible like the the specs on

787
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:27,720
it I think it's got 16 gigs of RAM and a

788
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:29,280
64 gig em - I believe it had I mean

789
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,070
we're gonna be reviewing this in the in

790
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,780
the coming in the coming weeks so but

791
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,670
there are some devices that are coming

792
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,780
out that just blast past the Raspberry

793
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:39,350
Pi 3 but they're different

794
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:43,160
cases absolutely different use cases

795
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:47,550
thank you very much for your comment

796
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:51,180
okay so we have one from calves I

797
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:56,400
believe its calves one stilts we'll take

798
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:58,650
it yeah I hope she's close I think this

799
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,390
is why I give her all the reading so I

800
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,480
don't have to try to pronounce my candy

801
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:05,760
means that our names I don't know yeah

802
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,320
okay so I have been staring at that red

803
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,179
laptop in front of Sasha for the past

804
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,550
few episodes please tell me what

805
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:14,100
computer is that I'm extremely curious

806
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:16,740
as I am an alienware and MSI Apache

807
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,500
owner but figure out what system is in

808
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:22,020
front of her with the mighty big screen

809
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:24,060
seriously you have no idea keep up the

810
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,070
great work by the way I loved Orville

811
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,960
and hated that they what they've done in

812
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,480
the name of Star Trek with Discovery

813
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,150
I was already disappointed with those

814
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,070
new Star Trek movie reboots mixing up

815
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:37,890
the Star Trek cannons characters and

816
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:40,260
timelines is a supposedly follow-up to

817
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:42,510
the original what they've done with

818
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,740
discovery is criminal stop two things

819
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:50,100
one I agree with you or evil is awesome

820
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:54,810
so my computer like four actually what

821
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:56,399
it is like it's a red Toshiba it's a red

822
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,620
computer so you're talking to a lien

823
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,450
we're like you're talking like really

824
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:15,540
high-end stuff compared to a Toshiba

825
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:17,400
mine yeah mine was a gift from the like

826
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,320
the Christmas gift he got me I say the

827
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,540
first Christmas we were together right

828
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,740
right so just like a like I really nice

829
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,140
how he asked me what I wanted I said I

830
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,310
need a laptop there you go it's done

831
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,100
really well and you've had different

832
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:32,130
flavors of a boon to and exactly no s on

833
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:36,320
there it's running mitaina wise running

834
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:39,270
Zora and I love Guren - so yeah cool

835
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,340
there you have it it's literally just a

836
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,110
little Toshiba notebook and it's it is

837
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,400
pretty sweet though I like the the bezel

838
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,230
on it oh good

839
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,270
looks good it's cool it works really

840
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,660
well Ricky yeah she uses it as a

841
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:56,720
teleprompter in a chat room computer it

842
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:59,130
lives here yeah but it has done me well

843
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,770
thank you for your question speaking of

844
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,260
teleprompter we're gonna head on over to

845
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,480
the news and we do have more of your

846
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,680
viewer questions comments they're gonna

847
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,049
be coming up in just a couple of moments

848
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,970
as well let's stick around but in the

849
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:14,700
meantime Sasha over to you with with the

850
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,349
newsroom soon all right here are the

851
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,289
stories we're covering this week in the

852
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:21,390
category 5 TV newsroom the in-browser

853
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:24,390
mining of cryptocurrency is becoming a

854
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,490
serious issue a new machine is going to

855
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,609
print metal parts at a tenth of the cost

856
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:31,140
of today's manufacturing systems

857
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:33,839
potentially launching a revolution in

858
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:36,980
small part production keep your iPhone

859
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,230
10 warm otherwise it may not work and

860
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,240
Intel versus AMD forget about it the

861
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,880
arch rivals are working together to

862
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,329
bring out a new hybrid these stories are

863
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,460
coming right up don't go anywhere

oh I don't know where I think you're

869

I'm Sasha Rickman and here the top

887
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,670
stories were following this week it has

888
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,770
now been confirmed the crypto jacking

889
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:56,300
craze that maxes out your CPU is

890
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:59,970
exploiting at least 2,500 websites a

891
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,860
researcher has documented almost 2,500

892
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,140
sites that are actively running

893
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,390
cryptocurrency mining code in the

894
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:09,000
browser's of unsuspecting visitors a

895
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:11,910
finding that suggests the unethical and

896
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,920
possibly illegal practice practice has

897
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,800
only just picked up steam since it first

898
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,930
came to light a few weeks ago William de

899
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,910
Groot the independent security

900
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,490
researcher who reported the findings

901
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:27,270
last week says that he believes all of

902
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:29,400
the 2,496 sites he tracked are running

903
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:32,190
out of date software with known security

904
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,050
vulnerabilities he further explained

905
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:36,390
that these vulnerabilities are being

906
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:39,810
exploited by the attackers who then user

907
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:42,030
access to ad code the code secretly

908
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:44,160
harnesses the electricity and CPUs of

909
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:47,250
visitors to generate the digital

910
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,960
currency known as Manero about 80

911
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,480
percent of those sites he added also

912
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,080
contain other types of malware that can

913
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,850
steal visitors payment card details oh

914
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,530
it's not just smaller sites that are

915
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:01,050
affected either for example when the

916
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:03,840
researcher visited the Australia Subaru

917
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,300
page which contained the code the CPU on

918
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,730
his macbook began spiking and the fan

919
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,680
could also be heard he says besides

920
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,050
putting a noticeable strain on my

921
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,300
computer the site also draws additional

922
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:17,760
electricity from my office the

923
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,350
arrangement allows the attackers to reap

924
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,600
the benefits of my hardware and

925
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:24,030
electricity without providing anything

926
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,830
to me in return there are other

927
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,450
indications that the in-browser crypto

928
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:30,480
mining racket is getting worse

929
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:32,790
- in a report published Tuesday endpoint

930
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,550
security provider malwarebytes said that

931
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,890
on average it performs about 8 million

932
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:43,800
blocks per day - unauthorized mining

933
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:45,630
pages that's a lot ok yeah I know a lot

934
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,760
about like the cryptocurrency Bitcoin

935
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,510
but I don't know anything really over

936
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,130
here a lot of

937
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,650
Bitcoin bitcoin is the one in the news

938
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:56,730
all the time right right so what is

939
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:58,410
Manero and how and why and just Bitcoin

940
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,020
do this too but how if I does monaro

941
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:03,270
need to leech CPU and oh well I mean

942
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,150
crypto cryptocurrency mining is the

943
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,950
process of using many computers

944
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,630
hopefully you have many computers at

945
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:15,900
your disposal to do this to to generate

946
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:18,390
revenue through cryptocurrency and by

947
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,680
doing that and and the way that Manero

948
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:24,450
is doing it is a little different

949
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,370
because just the whole nature of kind of

950
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,190
the backend end and there's a JavaScript

951
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:31,350
that's that's allowing both malicious

952
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:36,390
and good you know good well-meaning

953
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:38,190
folks to to you to mine Manero they can

954
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:40,590
do this in a browser that which kind of

955
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:43,050
changes the the whole kind of idea

956
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:45,420
behind it so cryptocurrency of course

957
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:47,460
has to be generated by mining which you

958
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,410
know I don't pretend to really overly

959
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,570
understand it's very very in-depth and

960
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:53,220
when you go from Bitcoin to Manero it's

961
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:56,250
different and you know but similar in

962
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,680
many ways Manero is completely as far as

963
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,500
I understand completely anonymous though

964
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,660
where Bitcoin it is anonymous I mean

965
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,850
they're Bitcoin isn't like you they

966
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:09,240
can't necessarily track it back to you

967
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:11,940
but every transaction that happens in

968
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,280
Bitcoin is trackable to the public ID of

969
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,110
the account where an arrow is completely

970
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,450
private the public ID doesn't reference

971
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,710
the transactions whatsoever so people

972
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,110
can't see how much money you have and

973
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:27,990
things like that so what happens here is

974
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:29,430
that okay so basically like I could if I

975
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,520
wanted to cut the ads down on our

976
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:35,610
website I could add code that would

977
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:39,060
allow my website to use your computer to

978
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:40,860
mine mineiro so basically generated

979
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:44,010
generating revenue by way of

980
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,930
cryptocurrency for me which in you know

981
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:48,660
if I were open and honest about that

982
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,970
which I would be and said you know click

983
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,460
here to say yes to this and to accept

984
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,230
this then that would be fine and that's

985
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,590
legitimate but what's happened here is

986
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:00,150
that somebody has picked up on this

987
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,080
capability of Manero and the JavaScript

988
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,750
behind it

989
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,460
and has turned it into malware so that

990
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,870
it distributes itself to all different

991
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,220
websites that don't necessarily

992
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,200
authorize it

993
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,240
that whose users don't authorize it to

994
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:16,610
do this and so now they've got this

995
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:19,620
massive farm of computers 2,500 servers

996
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:22,530
that are infected so every computer that

997
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:25,590
visits those websites are now mining

998
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,570
cryptocurrency for not subaru not the

999
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:30,150
company that's running the website but

1000
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:32,940
instead the the malicious person who has

1001
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:36,270
created that malware so that's where you

1002
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,380
know it's a very fine line of here's

1003
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,450
something that could have been used for

1004
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,050
good and it's already being used for

1005
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:46,590
naughty purposes a question about the

1006
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:48,300
idea of like creating mineiro so can I

1007
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,520
do that at home look could you turn it

1008
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,320
home and just yeah install the mining

1009
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,480
software and right but you've got one

1010
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,040
computer and you know good luck making

1011
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,100
any money on it you're gonna you know

1012
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,690
cryptocurrency mining takes a lot of CPU

1013
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,160
power and that's why they do this that's

1014
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,990
why yeah it's like we've talked about

1015
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,490
botnets and things like that you you

1016
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,320
need a supercomputer to be able to do

1017
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:09,630
this kind of stuff and maybe that's why

1018
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,870
some of these botnets exist maybe

1019
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,680
they're mining currency I don't know

1020
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,880
yeah you could do it on a single

1021
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,650
computer but you need to leave it

1022
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,450
running all the time and would it offset

1023
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,550
the cost of the hydro that it uses in

1024
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:25,080
order to mine that that cryptocurrency

1025
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:27,510
probably not right thanks Ravi no

1026
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,210
problem speaking of supercomputers there

1027
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:32,730
is a new machine that's going to print

1028
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:34,200
metal parts at a tenth of the cost of

1029
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,750
today's manufacturing systems

1030
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,450
potentially launching a revolution in

1031
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:42,060
small part production desktop metal

1032
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:44,550
based in Boston USA has opened up

1033
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:47,070
pre-orders for its studio system which

1034
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:49,860
uses inkjet like technology rather than

1035
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:52,860
laser based technologies to produce

1036
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:55,080
precision metal parts the system isn't

1037
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:57,090
cheap it's one hundred and twenty

1038
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,460
thousand dollars to buy outright or four

1039
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:01,920
thousand dollars a month for 36 months

1040
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,960
but compared to other ways of producing

1041
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,140
metal parts especially in small numbers

1042
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,540
it could be a game-changer sure there

1043
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,310
are already CNC machines that cost from

1044
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:14,310
thousands up to hundreds of thousands of

1045
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,789
dollars but this fad gizmo is supposed

1046
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:17,880
to

1047
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:20,429
be a challenge to that the printer will

1048
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,259
be made available in mid 2018 at which

1049
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:24,509
point the company hopes to expand even

1050
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:26,969
further with a product vert production

1051
00:44:24,509 --> 00:44:30,089
version of the machine the production

1052
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:32,669
version will offer 3d printing at 100

1053
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:36,059
times the speed and the 20th of the cost

1054
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:38,309
of current systems traditionally metal

1055
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:40,499
3d printing has been used only for

1056
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:43,079
prototyping given the slow speed in high

1057
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:45,150
cost of making each part once a design

1058
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,459
is finalized it then goes to traditional

1059
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:50,489
excute extrusion and casting methods for

1060
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:51,989
both production desktop metal claims to

1061
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:54,479
be able to turn that model on its head

1062
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:57,029
bringing the price down so significantly

1063
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:58,739
that it may be cheaper to use its system

1064
00:44:57,029 --> 00:45:00,479
for many products rather than requiring

1065
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:03,719
expensive tooling equipment to be

1066
00:45:00,479 --> 00:45:05,579
created for bulk production it can print

1067
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:09,029
items with a range of metals including

1068
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:11,729
steel Steel's copper and titanium using

1069
00:45:09,029 --> 00:45:13,829
commercially available powders and what

1070
00:45:11,729 --> 00:45:15,900
makes their solution unique is the

1071
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:18,809
printing process itself as well as the

1072
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,880
quality of the parts manufactured the 3d

1073
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:23,759
printing system works in much the same

1074
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,380
way except in three dimensions placing a

1075
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:28,199
layer of ink or in this case metal

1076
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,759
powder on top of a previous layer it's

1077
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:32,039
not that simple of course the machine

1078
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:33,959
also sprays plastic plastic binding

1079
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:37,169
agent and layers of wax in a very

1080
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:39,959
specific specific pattern the final

1081
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:42,059
printed part is placed in a D bind fluid

1082
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:44,640
that breaks down most of the wax and

1083
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:46,140
most of the plastic before being placed

1084
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,789
in a furnace where the rest of the

1085
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,849
binding agent which has a boiling point

1086
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:54,419
of just below the metal is burned off

1087
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:57,199
leaving just the metal the metal fuses

1088
00:45:54,419 --> 00:46:01,799
and creating a density of between 96 and

1089
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:04,019
99.8% according to desktop metal amazing

1090
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:07,619
final finishing then completes the

1091
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:09,179
process 3d printed parts are still going

1092
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:11,189
to work out to be more expensive than

1093
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:12,809
bulk production in the traditional ways

1094
00:46:11,189 --> 00:46:15,209
but the cost reduction means that

1095
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:17,880
producing a small number of units is

1096
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:19,769
going to be cheaper in some cases that

1097
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,189
may mean that a company would not need

1098
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:25,349
to buy bulk product parts at all

1099
00:46:22,189 --> 00:46:28,740
unbelievable yeah I love this idea I'll

1100
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:31,680
tell you I worked as a college student

1101
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:34,050
in a car manufacturing plant so we're

1102
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,290
talking like really big steel metal

1103
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:41,190
parts and stuff right and so I'm sort of

1104
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:44,040
familiar with stamping of metals and you

1105
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:47,760
know some of the more I guess injection

1106
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:50,040
molding things so I have an idea of what

1107
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,380
like a big scale situation would be but

1108
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,650
then I don't quite understand small

1109
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,570
scale my dream here with this kind of

1110
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,190
technology you think about the extruding

1111
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,650
systems and think about the quarter of

1112
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:04,619
million dollar machines that are doing

1113
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:07,500
that extruding process and doing the

1114
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:09,990
molds and everything else so picture if

1115
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,850
you so right now and this is a problem

1116
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:13,140
that we've had ever since the automobile

1117
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:16,020
came into existence and we'll use that

1118
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:19,290
as the example there's such a demand on

1119
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,000
the automobile itself that in order for

1120
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,130
a car manufacturer to be able to

1121
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,820
manufacture a car they also have to

1122
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:29,520
manufacture millions of parts spare

1123
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,530
parts so that 10 years from now when

1124
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,380
people are still driving that car they

1125
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:37,290
can still source those parts right so

1126
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,660
we've got this overabundance of waste

1127
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:41,850
material that may or may not even be

1128
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:44,280
used and they really don't have any way

1129
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:46,440
to know and so the cost is you know the

1130
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,450
cost is unimaginably cheap if you can

1131
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,270
get a machine for $120,000 that'll print

1132
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:53,580
parts versus having to print that many

1133
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:55,500
spare parts so you think about that and

1134
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,990
then think about taking your car to a

1135
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,330
shop and you know how many times have

1136
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:02,250
you heard this oh it's the part will be

1137
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:05,310
here at the end of the week and we can

1138
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:08,040
install it on Monday so instead how

1139
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:10,440
about this yeah oh yeah we've got the

1140
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,970
the 3d rendering for that for that part

1141
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,680
well we'll manufacture that for you this

1142
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,390
afternoon we've got one of those

1143
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,690
machines in the back can you imagine

1144
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:21,240
right so now the responsibility comes

1145
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:23,010
off of the automotive manufacturer to

1146
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,320
source these parts and now they can

1147
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:29,910
instead source blueprints and 3d

1148
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:33,119
renderings that now a shop themselves

1149
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:35,400
they could easily invest $120,000 in one

1150
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,350
of these 3d printers can now create

1151
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,480
their own replacement parts would that

1152
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,820
be fantastic

1153
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,130
so you know better for the environment

1154
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:45,560
better for you know the earth in general

1155
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:48,440
and and just the the amount of waste

1156
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:51,589
that there must be in these kinds of big

1157
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:54,380
manufacturing industries I have a quick

1158
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:56,540
question about the actual way they they

1159
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:01,160
do it because they're saying inkjet

1160
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:03,410
technology versus laser or inkjet like

1161
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,640
right yeah they call it inkjet like

1162
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,829
because you think about an inkjet

1163
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,369
printer going back and forth and

1164
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:14,839
printing multiple colors right so this

1165
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:17,780
is printing multiple layers of the the

1166
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:19,369
various metal materials so lasers are

1167
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,990
quite a bit different and and quite a

1168
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:23,900
bit more expensive because you think

1169
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:27,140
about lasers have to superheat the metal

1170
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:31,520
and they're very very expensive they're

1171
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:34,190
big and you know the cost of a laser 3d

1172
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,070
printing machine is unbelievable that's

1173
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:38,869
why right now they print one part and

1174
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:41,210
once they've perfected it 3d printed

1175
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:43,940
that one part then they take it to the

1176
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:46,099
traditional extrusion process and all

1177
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,410
that kind of stuff so this would if the

1178
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:51,020
cost of that was lower and they wouldn't

1179
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:54,200
have to like make dyes and things oh

1180
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:56,750
yeah and the machines themselves and can

1181
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,460
I change modes just quickly before we

1182
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:01,010
move on to the next story and we're

1183
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,950
using the example the example of the

1184
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:07,849
automotive industry on the super vette

1185
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:09,770
my wife and and my daughter Tali watch a

1186
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:13,280
show called the super vette there was a

1187
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:15,950
poor dog who had a tumor growing on its

1188
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,540
head and in order to operate on this

1189
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:20,900
tumor they had to remove part of the

1190
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:23,930
dog's skull and they were able to save

1191
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:26,930
this poor animal and the animal survived

1192
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:30,500
and is you know lived a great life after

1193
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:34,310
that how did they do it they 3d printed

1194
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:38,150
a replacement part in metal of that

1195
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:40,339
dog's skull and replaced then replaced

1196
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:42,800
the portion of the skull that was that

1197
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:45,349
had to be removed so it really would

1198
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,730
work well on them on so many levels

1199
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:51,040
that's like what a stark contrast from

1200
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:53,440
building parts for

1201
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,690
an automobile to saving an animal's life

1202
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,900
you know what I would print if I could

1203
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:03,070
out of metal new frames for my glasses

1204
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:04,780
like all the time you know I got bondic

1205
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:07,240
and and bondic works really well for

1206
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:09,550
that kind of stuff it's a plastic welder

1207
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,570
in that that's pretty cool I kind of

1208
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,460
want to bring it on the show just

1209
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:14,130
because it has saved so many little

1210
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:17,710
components that I've been fixing with

1211
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:19,750
melted plastic yeah it's neat I love it

1212
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,910
when things like this just are developed

1213
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:24,160
and they become I mean I realized right

1214
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:26,530
now the price point is high but the fact

1215
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,960
that it exists means that eventually the

1216
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:31,030
price is going to be lower I'm going

1217
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,220
about this forever but you think you

1218
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:35,260
know one company invests in that machine

1219
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,180
now let's rent it out to other companies

1220
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,250
let's take that automotive part

1221
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:41,740
manufacturing machine and let the vet

1222
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:46,930
the local vet rent it out and right

1223
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:49,830
right no limits what what ideas do you

1224
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:54,550
have for this 3d printing middle machine

1225
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:57,990
all right spaceship parts on Mars all

1226
00:51:54,550 --> 00:52:03,760
right so back to some phone issues

1227
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:06,580
apples $1,000 iPhone 10 may have trouble

1228
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,500
operating in the winter weather this is

1229
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,330
according to multiple complaints from

1230
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,800
owners as well as it admission from

1231
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:14,080
Apple themselves that in cold

1232
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,119
temperatures the O LED touchscreen in

1233
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:19,150
the expensive new handsets can become

1234
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:21,160
temporarily unresponsive when taking an

1235
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,810
iPhone 10 outside and chilly weather

1236
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,460
users have found that the device

1237
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:27,880
struggle to notice finger swipes and

1238
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:30,280
gestures the iPhone 10 uses a five point

1239
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,770
eight five inch LED display and

1240
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,650
apparently it is particularly sensitive

1241
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:37,270
to changes in temperature the timing of

1242
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,340
the engineering blender is going to be

1243
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:40,930
particularly troublesome as the autumn

1244
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:46,780
weather turns to winter for most of the

1245
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:48,580
world and temperatures drop so I realize

1246
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,990
that phones have like they've been

1247
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,490
getting a bad rap right now because like

1248
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:53,260
it seems like every phone that's

1249
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:56,560
released it's something that's happening

1250
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:59,230
yeah this one is interesting because I

1251
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,900
mean touchscreens you're now that

1252
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:03,550
they're always available you expect them

1253
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,660
to be super responsive so to have

1254
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,510
something leggy

1255
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:11,109
it's gonna make you look especially in

1256
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:13,809
the Canadian winter you imagine so is it

1257
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:15,400
I wonder the fact that the temperature

1258
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:16,839
of your finger in the cold weather would

1259
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,339
be the same as the temperature of the

1260
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:21,190
phone because when you think about going

1261
00:53:18,339 --> 00:53:22,569
outside your hands get cold and your

1262
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:24,819
phone is cold but it's not going to

1263
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:28,329
really notice that like if it's sensing

1264
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:30,369
warmth from your hand yeah I'm not too

1265
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:33,010
sure how the technology works I think

1266
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:34,630
it's it's easy to fall into thinking oh

1267
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:36,520
it's the OLED display that's a problem

1268
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:38,049
well no understand that the OLED display

1269
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,210
is the the picture that you're seeing

1270
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:42,250
and the the touch screen aspect of that

1271
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:46,390
display is a layer that's been added on

1272
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:48,730
top of that now Apple has has announced

1273
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:51,280
that you know in a response to this news

1274
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:53,890
story and the reddit discussion that's

1275
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,089
been going on Apple responded by saying

1276
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:57,039
that they're going to fix it with a

1277
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:59,740
firmware update so of course everybody

1278
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,880
goes what like this sounds so much like

1279
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,109
a hardware problem because we're

1280
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,420
thinking along the lines of an OLED

1281
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:05,559
display and you know it's the display

1282
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:08,380
it's got to be something wrong with the

1283
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:10,029
hardware but think about that layer of

1284
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,920
technology that's on top of that display

1285
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:13,869
that allows the touch sensitivity and

1286
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,410
the multi-touch and and being able to

1287
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:19,180
control it with your finger and so if

1288
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:21,069
they're able to release a firmware

1289
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,900
update that fixes this then it tells us

1290
00:54:21,069 --> 00:54:25,029
that most likely it's something to do

1291
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,910
with the underlying programming of that

1292
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:31,750
layer of the device so the algorithms

1293
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:33,309
that essentially sense your ear touch so

1294
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:36,099
maybe they need to make it more

1295
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:38,049
sensitive maybe they need to monitor the

1296
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:39,819
temperature and hey when it gets cold we

1297
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:42,789
need to increase the sensitivity because

1298
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:44,740
that layer is you know it takes a little

1299
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:45,609
bit to come down to temperature or

1300
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,349
something like that

1301
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:50,470
I'm not sure they you know we don't

1302
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:52,750
really know yet what the actual issue is

1303
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:55,000
right I know gene yes I'll tell you but

1304
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:56,859
I am going to just hazard a guess it has

1305
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,599
something to do with cold fingers that's

1306
00:54:56,859 --> 00:54:59,890
what I think I think it's the fingers

1307
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:01,240
and the phone gonna tell us that you

1308
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,470
need to you need to breathe on your

1309
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,299
hands first before you use your

1310
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:06,640
brand-new thousand-dollar Ivan it's

1311
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:08,319
really cold hands so I feel like I I I

1312
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,390
might not do well with it

1313
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:12,369
iPhone 10 this is where you know you

1314
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,740
gotta get into controlling everything

1315
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:16,660
with Bluetooth folks that's where pixels

1316
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,530
got it right control it with your

1317
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:21,340
headphones

1318
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:24,160
that's right there you go intel has

1319
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:26,830
teamed up with archrival AMD to create a

1320
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,140
powerful new processor the unlikely pair

1321
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:31,540
working together on a new unified chip

1322
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:33,670
that integrates Intel's core CPU

1323
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:36,250
architecture with AMD's graphic

1324
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:38,320
technology intel says that the new

1325
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:40,060
processor should deliver the same sort

1326
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:43,000
of gaming performance as current gen

1327
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:46,270
discrete notebook GPUs but in a smaller

1328
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,420
less power hungry size this will allow

1329
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:51,580
OMS and system makers to create thin and

1330
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,590
light laptop laptops that provide the

1331
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:56,080
graphic power that gamers and content

1332
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:58,540
creators look for the innovation doesn't

1333
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:01,780
stop there however the new fangled chip

1334
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:03,820
will also carry a new low-power HBM to

1335
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:06,940
graphics memory this takes up less space

1336
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:10,720
and provides greater performance than

1337
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:13,390
traditional ddrs GPU memory Intel said

1338
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,460
in a press release the new product which

1339
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:17,260
will be part of our 8th gen Intel Core

1340
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,050
family brings together our high

1341
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:23,290
performing intel core h series processor

1342
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:25,690
2nd generation high bandwidth memory and

1343
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:27,300
a custom to Intel third-party discrete

1344
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:30,070
graphics chip from AMD's Radeon

1345
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:33,850
technologies group all in a single

1346
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:37,240
processor package when can we expect to

1347
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:40,630
buy this hybrid Intel AMD processor as

1348
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:42,370
early as next year intel says that

1349
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:44,170
they'll be revealing more about the chip

1350
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:47,170
including the branding and devices that

1351
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:51,010
make use of it in the coming months hmm

1352
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:54,700
so is that it blows my mind that in

1353
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:58,660
today's kind of climate that two rival

1354
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:00,670
companies would really like it was let's

1355
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,530
do this let's build something better and

1356
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:05,320
I can already see like it's gonna be

1357
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,190
super beneficial like it's going to be

1358
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,170
amazing

1359
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,690
yeah how thin do we need to get here

1360
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,820
Intel well we need to get to the point

1361
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:16,720
that you see in all of the movies like

1362
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:19,000
where where they get its if the laptop

1363
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,250
is as small as a piece of paper like it

1364
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,790
needs to be read it needs to be same it

1365
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:29,900
needs to get like ridiculous the i7

1366
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:34,160
powers if I'm not mistaken the the Apple

1367
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:36,049
MacBook Air and that is super super thin

1368
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:39,140
that's an Intel processor so if they're

1369
00:57:36,049 --> 00:57:40,849
saying that hey this team up with AMD is

1370
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:44,480
going to give us something even thinner

1371
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:48,069
could you imagine oh boy that's gonna be

1372
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,930
paper-thin for sure man I love life

1373
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:52,670
big thanks to Roy W Nash in our

1382
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:14,299
Sasha this is category 5 technology TV

1383
00:58:12,049 --> 00:58:15,470
and our website is category 5 dot TV

1384
00:58:14,299 --> 00:58:17,750
welcome to the show

1385
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:19,270
we've got your viewer questions comments

1386
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:24,619
we're gonna jump right back into that

1387
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:28,460
Sasha what's next Steve Delaney says hi

1388
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:30,770
Robbie remember my idea of your eyes of

1389
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:33,020
your phone being your main computer with

1390
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:35,569
three type-a USB ports 4 keyboard mouse

1391
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:38,089
flash drives yes I think they're doing

1392
00:58:35,569 --> 00:58:41,779
that man did you patent it did you

1393
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:44,900
register the dot-com I hope so yeah okay

1394
00:58:41,779 --> 00:58:46,460
so Steve says I think that any cast

1395
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,650
device you showed might be better suited

1396
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:51,079
to this then say chromecast I read that

1397
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:53,900
chromecast is not here on all phones and

1398
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:55,910
only streams I also heard that there is

1399
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,369
a two or three second delay between the

1400
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:01,579
phone and the screen oh so you can't

1401
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:04,609
play any phone games on your TV on

1402
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:06,589
chromecast worse you can't really use a

1403
00:59:04,609 --> 00:59:08,390
word processor because the time delay

1404
00:59:06,589 --> 00:59:10,400
would drive you crazy I believe you

1405
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:13,569
that's like me when I type computer

1406
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:16,520
can't keep up I'm like some wind

1407
00:59:13,569 --> 00:59:17,960
chromecast didn't just mirrors beyond me

1408
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,270
since YouTube videos can be played in

1409
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,760
full-screen mode to be honest I've never

1410
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:25,000
even heard of slimport before you

1411
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:28,609
mentioned it oh yeah does anyone

1412
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,049
slimport oh yeah under the desk here

1413
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:35,869
that's this little guy that converts

1414
00:59:30,049 --> 00:59:38,140
that USB port on your phone into what

1415
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:43,630
does it do

1416
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:45,420
full hdmi output for your smartphone how

1417
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:49,029
cool is that

1418
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:51,670
Steve ends by saying does anyone else

1419
00:59:49,029 --> 00:59:53,589
except you care about the end user I

1420
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:59,369
couldn't think they care but they just

1421
00:59:53,589 --> 01:00:03,819
don't care as much thank you Steve

1422
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:06,579
okay so we have from Noah hi dear

1423
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:09,339
category-five team I love to watch your

1424
01:00:06,579 --> 01:00:10,960
show every Thursday it's very helpful

1425
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:12,369
and fun to watch it gets really

1426
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,950
confusing for those who are watching on

1427
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:16,359
Sunday as they hear us saying you know

1428
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,680
it's Wednesday and you're watching

1429
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:20,019
Thursday and you're watching Friday

1430
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,359
that's the nature of television these

1431
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:24,369
days folks that's how it works exactly

1432
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:26,470
you're watching Thursday's thanks for

1433
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:29,079
tuning in well the thing is no one

1434
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:32,319
doesn't watch it live either because in

1435
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:35,589
Germany we air live at one o'clock in

1436
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:38,650
the morning right so you can stay up

1437
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:41,200
come on no we stayed up no we're up at

1438
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:44,259
one o'clock in the morning your time no

1439
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:47,559
watches on YouTube which is awesome so

1440
01:00:44,259 --> 01:00:50,230
that's great so Noah really likes how

1441
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:51,910
the the guide on how to install the plex

1442
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:57,190
media server on the Raspberry Pi which

1443
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:58,390
was episode 459 awesome so as soon as

1444
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,180
Noah saw that video

1445
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:03,369
they bought he bought a Raspberry Pi and

1446
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:05,349
installed Plex sweet and since then I've

1447
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:07,660
subscribed to the YouTube channel so

1448
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:09,069
thank you for that one guys for your

1449
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:13,450
subscription one question is there a way

1450
01:01:09,069 --> 01:01:15,999
to watch the show on Plex a way to watch

1451
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:18,880
the show on Plex yes get onto our

1452
01:01:15,999 --> 01:01:22,739
website it's category-five dot TV so if

1453
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:25,210
I bring it up category five dot TV and

1454
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:28,599
boy it's hard to type on these little

1455
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:30,279
tiny things he says yeah but not when

1456
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:32,829
I'm holding it with one hand and they've

1457
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:36,730
got these crazy keys yeah you guys see

1458
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:39,609
this no I'm serious grass but these keys

1459
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:43,509
what is all this what is that gibberish

1460
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:46,450
I don't know anyway so you get on to

1461
01:01:43,509 --> 01:01:48,549
category 5 TV click on subscribe at the

1462
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:50,760
bottom of the page and you'll see our

we could be watched on any platform

1471
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:10,280
pretty much yeah including cable channel

1472
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:14,220
33 in the high desert

1473
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:17,820
alright orange man writes hey orange man

1474
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:19,860
dear Robi I was given an old HP ProLiant

1475
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:22,410
Pro server as the owner didn't need it

1476
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:24,000
he told me that it overheated that said

1477
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:26,640
it was kept in a cupboard under the

1478
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,930
stairs with no ventilation so it has

1479
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:34,260
well gigabytes of memory Wow and a Xeon

1480
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:37,560
processor with 4 cores it's got 5 SATA

1481
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:40,590
drive bays and eights a space of which I

1482
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:44,190
sent you the drives oh yeah we thank you

1483
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:46,200
for that I hope you saw the video I've

1484
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:49,980
installed a boon to server on it and I

1485
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:53,160
have 8 terabytes of disk space with 2

1486
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:55,950
times 2 terabyte drives ok so 2 2

1487
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:58,560
terabyte drives and a 4 terabyte drive I

1488
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:00,780
used it as a very large file server

1489
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:04,410
holding about 6 terabytes of data and

1490
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:07,440
before you ask I do have two backups of

1491
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:10,800
all the data good cuz it with for three

1492
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,960
drives at for 2 plus 2 plus 4 that means

1493
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,540
you have no redundancy if you've got 8

1494
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,130
terabytes exact Orange I'd rather see

1495
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:21,090
you with some redundancy there like set

1496
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:24,030
up the to 2 terabytes as a raid 1 yeah

1497
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:25,980
yeah so so Orangemen knows that the

1498
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:28,500
server has a lot of processing power but

1499
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,480
has some more questions oh yeah is it

1500
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,820
worth adding another Xeon processor

1501
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,240
there is space on the motherboard for a

1502
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:40,500
second processor is it worth adding more

1503
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:42,630
memory hmm ok so first first who pays

1504
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,230
your hydro bill who pays for your

1505
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:49,020
electricity because those eons are

1506
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:52,350
electricity suckers like they just drink

1507
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:54,630
it up and use it up so if you add

1508
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:56,460
another processor it's going to use you

1509
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:58,770
know it twice as much electricity as

1510
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:01,110
that old Xeon processor so I'd imagine

1511
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:03,180
that this is an older server so they

1512
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:05,640
used to be very inefficient

1513
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:07,020
that way so so check out the process or

1514
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,700
find out how many watts of electricity

1515
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:10,109
it's going to use and then make that

1516
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:13,339
determination do you need the extra

1517
01:04:10,109 --> 01:04:15,390
processing power the extra four cores or

1518
01:04:13,339 --> 01:04:16,800
do you think that it's better just to

1519
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:20,280
save the money on the electricity bill

1520
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:22,410
and and leave it as it is but if your

1521
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:27,300
system supports it then like I've got a

1522
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:30,359
two CPU Xeon processor at home which

1523
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:33,630
runs our on raid server and it is just a

1524
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:35,700
cost beast like it cost me so much money

1525
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:38,190
to run it I'm ready to deprecate it but

1526
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,270
I need to move so much stuff over to get

1527
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:40,890
rid of it

1528
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:42,569
but it costs us we bought one of those

1529
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:45,780
devices that tells us how much our

1530
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:49,290
electricity is costing us plugged in the

1531
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:51,510
server oh it was brutal like we're

1532
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:53,160
talking half of my electricity bill was

1533
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:56,099
going to the server you want to you want

1534
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,059
to get rid of those old things next

1535
01:04:56,099 --> 01:05:00,150
question

1536
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:02,010
it can Orangemen disconnect the

1537
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:05,099
controller board connecting to the SAS

1538
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:11,910
drive bays because we have the SAS drive

1539
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:14,130
oh dude he kept the controller sent us

1540
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:15,900
the drive drives but not the controller

1541
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:20,700
so you've got a bunch of drives but we

1542
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:22,369
don't have a controller and then we

1543
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:25,799
could use the drives that would be cool

1544
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:27,270
but but you can pull it or use it or

1545
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:28,980
whatever I mean it's it's in there

1546
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:30,839
already but you've pulled the the SAS

1547
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:34,079
drives can you use it for

1548
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:37,770
SATA yeah if you want to add more drives

1549
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:42,000
to the system unlike SATA SAS is

1550
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:45,720
backward compatible to s to SATA so SATA

1551
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,809
buses you cannot connect SAS drives but

1552
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:51,690
SAS buses you can connect either SAS or

1553
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:55,470
SATA I'm not sure if it's as fast as I

1554
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:56,849
think it's only a SATA 2 but you may

1555
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:58,920
want to check out the specs on that

1556
01:05:56,849 --> 01:06:01,319
check your SAS controller as well what

1557
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,780
the what the specifications are but yeah

1558
01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:06,180
that could be used for extra extra

1559
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:09,420
headers for your SATA drives for sure ok

1560
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:13,470
there's one last question why are there

1561
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:14,819
two 12-volt 38 amp power supplies and do

1562
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,660
both have to be plugged into the main

1563
01:06:14,819 --> 01:06:20,010
power to make the server work

1564
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:22,690
and what does each power supply power

1565
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:25,510
okay well okay think that this is a

1566
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:27,700
server right orange man so what that is

1567
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:30,670
it's not two power supplies per se like

1568
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:32,950
you're not getting two supplies of power

1569
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:35,500
they're called redundant power supplies

1570
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:37,510
so part of a server I mentioned having

1571
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,250
redundant storage so having a RAID one

1572
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:41,050
means if one of those two terabyte

1573
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:42,460
drives fails you've got the other one

1574
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:43,630
with the same data so you don't lose

1575
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:46,090
anything so then you stick in another

1576
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:48,640
two terabyte drive it rebuilds and

1577
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:50,980
you've not lost a thing similarily

1578
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:53,770
servers are built to have redundancy and

1579
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:57,280
power so if one of the power supplies

1580
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:59,590
burns out which happens it keeps running

1581
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,600
on the other power supply so then you

1582
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:03,820
have to just pull out the broken power

1583
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,290
supply replace it with a new one and

1584
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,030
then you're up and go you're still

1585
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:09,760
you're still up and going but then

1586
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:11,320
you're back to having redundancy so this

1587
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,040
is all because it's a server so it's

1588
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:16,780
meant to be reliable and always on so in

1589
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:20,290
a business environment you don't want

1590
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:22,690
your server being shut off by a power

1591
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,130
supply outage you want it to continue

1592
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:25,960
going so that's where the redundancy

1593
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:27,490
comes in then you can just pull and

1594
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,080
replace the power supply when it's

1595
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,760
convenient similarly with the hard drive

1596
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:33,940
redundancy and everything else it's all

1597
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:35,430
about redundancy on a reliable in-house

1598
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:38,200
server that's what that is

1599
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:39,880
perfect Thank You orange man and thank

1600
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,920
you for the sastras thank you very much

1601
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,530
I look forward to using them when we

1602
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:55,960
have a SAS controller because as I

1603
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:57,610
mentioned can't plug SAS in to SATA so

1604
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:01,440
yeah the picture that just came up sure

1605
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:05,140
isn't that great that is our website

1606
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,790
takes pictures of us as we're live on

1607
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,550
the air and that looks like it's like a

1608
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:12,790
posed picture but that actually is

1609
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:15,220
actually happening it's like wow yeah

1610
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:17,130
actually that just looked like a post

1611
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:19,660
shot and it's just random

1612
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:21,580
automatic by our website we've got some

1613
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:23,310
really neat tech here it's pretty cool

1614
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:26,250
stuff I love this show

1615
