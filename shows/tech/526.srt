to have you here. Last week we

65
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,349
got into it a little bit about

66
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,490
Star Trek versus the Orville and

67
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,569
YouTube has blown up. Really. Yeah.

68
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,870
Really enjoying the comments there.

69
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,310
I'm surprised at how many people

70
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,219
are very pro Orrville. Or someone

71
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,889
like me we're very much Star Trek

72
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,439
babies. It's inspired me to watch

73
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,550
it. I've only watched one episode

74
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,990
so far. I watched the first episode

75
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,870
of Doraville. I will get into it.

76
00:02:52,60 --> 00:02:53,939
We loved it. Lee Orrville last

77
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,520
episode loved it. Star Trek discovery

78
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,360
first episode well didn't necessarily

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,159
keep coming back that's sure not

80
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,330
to get back into it again tonight.

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
But that's kind of the conversation

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,699
that's happening on our YouTube

83
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,110

of this show now we are in season

the season and that means season

91
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,289
10 is a wrap. And finally I mean

92
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,719
it takes time and it's huge but

93
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,909
the season 10 bit torrent file

94
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,150
is now a little nice. You can now

95
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,120
download the entire season and

96
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,860
this time we've included extras

97
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,490
as well so behind the scenes put

98
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,150
up know bloopers. Yeah. So she's

99
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,659
Yamaguchi was here and she talked

100
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,340
about her standup comedy. We've

101
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,590
even in the extras included her

102
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,689

103
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,189
get that if you go over to torrent

104
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,560
doc Category5 TV and I know what

105
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,330
you think when thinking of here

106
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:59,69
I'm wondering if you put in the

107
00:03:59,69 --> 00:04:01,500
video of me dancing. You'll just

108
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,120
have to download this. I thought

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,889
that I was actually thinking you

110
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,419
might be thinking isn't bit torrent

111
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,419
illegal. Not no. Exactly. I know

112
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,710
that you know that's why you running

113
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,270
it. No. You already knew. I knew

114
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,430
it was. It's it's sometimes what

115
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,170
you do with the files. But up there

116
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,300
that's legal. Ah. All right. So

117
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,430

00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,279
and it is great to have you joining

188
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,0
us and thankfully saved the universe

189
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,839
by telling me Hey didn't you forget

190
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,560
to install the 12 volt eight pin

191
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,500
power cable which is the power

192
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,540
cable for the CQ. And we did. We

193
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,769
kind of we're running out of time

194
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,720
last week and along with that it's

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,769
like OK put it together and get

196
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,959
it going. And we fired it up without

197
00:07:22,50 --> 00:07:26,100
the CPA. So had we had HDMI output

198
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,899
going it would have just not fired

199
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:29,670
up.Now we had an hour but there

200
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,870
was no power to the CPE you or

201
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,459
at least it didn't have 12 volts

202
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,139
that it that it covered because

203
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,399
it's such a powerful little system.

204
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,560
So I put that on there. Thank you

205
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,899
Artie Blair for pointing that out.

206
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,399
It would have been noticed pretty

207
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,389
quickly but it could have been

208
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,310
noticed on the air. It would have

209
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,639
set us back a little bit. This

210
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,449
is a real serious team that belt.

211
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,449
This is a pretty big thing. And

212
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:52,860
if you want to be a part of the

213
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,89
community build even if you're

214
00:07:54,89 --> 00:07:55,589
seeing this two years from now

215
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,899
it's OK. Go to Cat 5 TV slash CPQ

216
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,259
2 0 1 7. That's the year that we're

217
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,360
broadcasting it. And it's a really

218
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,620
it has been it's been a community

219
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,50
built. The selection of hardware

220
00:08:07,50 --> 00:08:09,180
to why we selected it. The pricing

221
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,370
budgeting all that stuff has been

222
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:13,709
thanks to the community and now

223
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:14,939
as we get into this tonight we're

224
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,920
going to be setting up an operating

225
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,209
system that's recommended by the

226
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,750
community so how cool is that.

227
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,980
So let's get right into OK first

228
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,740
of all I did a couple of things

229
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,79
like this. A power cable that already

230
00:08:28,79 --> 00:08:30,180
Blair mentioned off the air just

231
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,490
before the show so I plugged that

232
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,659
in. The other thing that I did

233
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,629
is I plugged in this beautiful

234
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,320
Kingston hyper X savage hard drive

235
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,690
this hard drive.No it is an SSD.

236
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,970
I should say to be absolutely correct.

237
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,299
So this SSD Sasha is going to be

238
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:51,120
your data drive. So we've got the

239
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:52,789
two that you already installed

240
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,200
that is your OS drive right. And

241
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,9
then we're going to set up the

242
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,830
SSD because it's a terabyte drive

243
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,49
screamin fast it's beautiful and

244
00:09:01,49 --> 00:09:02,669
it is going to hold all your data.

245
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,799
So it's got a lot a lot more space.

246
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,169
Cool. That's like game data your

247
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,759
documents your pictures and somebody

248
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,500
said Agam Moto was looking at it

249
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,149
and saying why are you going so

250
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,70
overkill with things like the ram

251
00:09:14,70 --> 00:09:16,679
and things like the harddrive the

252
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,879
storage space. I can understand

253
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,289
them not to. But why are you getting

254
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:21,9
the terabyte SSD as well because

255
00:09:21,9 --> 00:09:22,679
it's pretty expensive. Well the

256
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,490
fact is we understand I understand

257
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:26,820
and the community understands that

258
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,259
Sasha is building this for Dave

259
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,539
as a gift her husband Dave and

260
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,340
it's a sweet gaming rig. I'll give

261
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,960
it that. If it was just a sweet

262
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,110
gaming rig I'm got to add 256 gigabytes

263
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,529
is going to be perfectly fine now

264
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,200
right. I understand though that

265
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,990
as your newlywed that this is not

266
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,549
only your gaming computer this

267
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:46,769
is also your family computer. Exactly.

268
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,149
This is the everything. This is

269
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:49,529
everything. So all of your family

270
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,330
photos and videos especially are

271
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,830
going to take up some space. Those

272
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,610
kinds of things are going to go

273
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,200
on there. So we want to make sure

274
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,340
that they're not only ready for

275
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,509
gaming and doing what they need

276
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,269
to do today but we're ready future

277
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,909
ready we're ready to be able to

278
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,500
use this thing for the next three

279
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,990
five years plus.That's the hope.

280
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,899
So we're going to get into it tonight.

281
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,49
First of all now that that's installed.

282
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:14,519
I've got to go through kind of

283
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,309
the BIOS setup so as I first fire

284
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:19,39
this thing up are we ready. Yes

285
00:10:19,39 --> 00:10:21,289
ready. You're ready. Yes. It's

286
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,669
ready to go. Fired up. And what

287
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:27,210
do we find. Oh Republic of gamers.

288
00:10:28,19 --> 00:10:29,940
Beautiful. I loved these boards.

289
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,830
So it's going to go right into

290
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,629
the BIOS first and foremost and

291
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:34,620
the first thing I notice is that

292
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,990
it's taken me to the extreme tweaker

293
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,509
which gives me this X MP feature

294
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,149
an SMP of course is extreme memory

295
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,610
profile from a Seuss. And basically

296
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,139
what that does is these settings

297
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,610
are going to allow me to set up

298
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,740
overclocking for you and Dave in

299
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,629
such a way that it's all automatic.

300
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:53,100
That's just warning me that we

301
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,320
need lots of cooling and we have

302
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,49
that. So as you can see it's now

303
00:10:58,49 --> 00:10:59,730
going to do all the cores it's

304
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,519
detected are 26 66 RAM from Kingston.

305
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,70
That's the fury RAM and everything

306
00:11:05,70 --> 00:11:07,19
is kind of auto. That means it's

307
00:11:07,19 --> 00:11:09,299
going to automatically adjust the

308
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:11,490
frequencies of the RAM the you

309
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,370
as it needs to in order to make

310
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,809
it as fast as possible. So you

311
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,700
see it clocks a four point two

312
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,529
gigahertz.They're two hundred megahertz.

313
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,690
But if I go back to extreme tweaker

314
00:11:22,80 --> 00:11:23,909
I can see that with the overclocking

315
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:25,389
it's going to go up to 40 five

316
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,59
hundred megahertz or 4.5 gigahertz.

317
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:31,240
OK so I'm going to save that setting.

318
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,220
So now we are officially overclocked.

319
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,190
In the simplest way possible answer

320
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,700
showing me what is going to change.

321
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:39,70
Can't get any simpler than that.

322
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,669
And now it just booted right back

323
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,649
into the bios so we need to look

324
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:45,909
at our boot devices and see that

325
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:48,639
our boot order is OK first of all.

326
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,470
So just scroll down here. I love

327
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,500
the interface. This BIOS utility

328
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,419
from from Republic of gamers looks

329
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:57,159
great. So I need to disable see

330
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,340
it's detecting the hard drives.

331
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,429
They got to they're going to disable

332
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:02,529
and then have to disable and that's

333
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:05,139
move that up and disable the s.a.a

334
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:07,659
drive as well. So now I have no

335
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:10,90
drive selected for boot because

336
00:12:10,90 --> 00:12:11,49
we don't want it to actually boot

337
00:12:11,49 --> 00:12:12,250
from that but I noticed that it's

338
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,269
not detected my U.S. bead right.

339
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,90
So I'm just going to save that

340
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,669
and unplug that plug it back in.

341
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,429
Let the BIOS know that hey there's

342
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,590
a USP drive so let's see what happens

343
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,779
here. See if it'll boot right up.

344
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,70
No. Went right back in. So here

345
00:12:30,70 --> 00:12:31,720
we go. Now I know that it supports

346
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,850
compatibility mode you can see

347
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,379
CSM is there. Oh and now you can

348
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,210
see the data traveler is a boot

349
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,70
option so you can see how that

350
00:12:39,70 --> 00:12:40,29
could get frustrating if you don't

351
00:12:40,29 --> 00:12:41,769
know to look for this thing.I need

352
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,360
to select that USP drive as my

353
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,360
boot disk and then save and reboot.

354
00:12:47,9 --> 00:12:50,649
Here we go. Moment of Truth overclocked

355
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,450
disable the hard drives as boot

356
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,710
devices they're still detected

357
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,80
and we've set it up to boot from

358
00:12:56,80 --> 00:12:58,250
the U.S. and there it is the familiar

359
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:01,750
Ubuntu kind of loading thing at

360
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,220
the bottom there. That's what that

361
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,190
is. Perfect thanks. So the distro

362
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,460
that I've got here is called Ubuntu.

363
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,750
Game pack I was looking for a gaming

364
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,389
Linux distribution and this is

365
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,159
based on 3:44 this is the LDS are

366
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,919
long term support version of a

367
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,840
boon too which means it's supported

368
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,129
until 2021 I think or 2022. Needless

369
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:26,529
to say it's going to be supported

370
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,779
for a good long time and that means

371
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,399
that you're not going to have to

372
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:32,49
reinstall your operating system

373
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,820
every six months. Thank you. Which

374
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,360
is good. So then when that LTA

375
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,440
cycle is done we can just simply

376
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,360
roll it up to the next LTI us.

377
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,100
Beautiful but that's about it.

378
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,590
So this is a boom to Linux. It's

379
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,59
available at Ubuntu dot com. But

380
00:13:46,59 --> 00:13:47,350
the particular flavor that we've

381
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,590
chosen is built specifically for

382
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,250
gamers gamers. So it's optimized

383
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,169
for gaming it comes pre-installed

384
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,450
with play on Linux. LUTER a steam

385
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,370
steam is something that we really

386
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,509
wanted to hosting is twitch on

387
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,379
Twitch TV is available through

388
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,870
your browser.So OK so I suppose

389
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,970
you could just bring it up in Chrome

390
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,100
or chromium. OK there you go. What

391
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,90
else. It's just it's got a ton

392
00:14:13,90 --> 00:14:14,799
of stuff so this one is a spin

393
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,570
off of a boon too and it's available

394
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,129
at you a Linux dot com. So sastra

395
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,899
that's all that I'm really allowed

396
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,279
to do. I kind of want you to take

397
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,80
over and we want to see how quickly

398
00:14:26,80 --> 00:14:27,610
we can do this and I see that it's

399
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,49
finished booting. We're at this

400
00:14:29,49 --> 00:14:32,350
screen to either try or install

401
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,659
Ubuntu. So if I move the mouse

402
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:36,879
over to you. Right. And we've got

403
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,59
a suite gaming mouse and wireless

404
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,100
gaming keyboard for them as well

405
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,169
as we all. Are so ready for it

406
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:47,919
because this is all you. There

407
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,240
you go. I don't know that you're

408
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,870
going to need the keyboard but

409
00:14:51,0 --> 00:14:53,19
there it is. Put it right in front

410
00:14:53,29 --> 00:14:55,120
of us. Sasha is in control now

411
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,59
and she's kind of like doing that.

412
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,379
Like what. I'm going to put it

413
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:00,820
right up here so when I bring it

414
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,200
up on the screen Sasha can see

415
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,29
it. Our TV in front of you there

416
00:15:04,29 --> 00:15:06,129
Sasha so click on install Ubuntu

417
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,620
click it and have an Emmy for it.

418
00:15:12,29 --> 00:15:14,669
OK. So do we want to install third

419
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:16,110
party software for graphics and

420
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,0
Wi-Fi hardware using E3 and other

421
00:15:18,0 --> 00:15:19,950
media. Absolutely. So check that

422
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,960
off. So that's going install like

423
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,250
your graphics drivers and things

424
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,740
like that.Hopefully I mean it'll

425
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,460
all work. So continue now you know

426
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,340
to download updates while installing

427
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,720
is is not an available option that

428
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,639
means that our internet is not

429
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,320
connected to this particular computer

430
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
right now. So we can run those

431
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,919
updates down the road or a little

432
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,289
bit later it doesn't matter. OK

433
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,929
come on now this is running from

434
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:46,259
a USP flash drive us flash drives

435
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:49,350
traditionally are quites. You know

436
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,389
they're not as slow as CD optical

437
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:53,789
media but they're a lot slower

438
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,200
than once this is installed on

439
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,549
the computer. So once this is on

440
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:58,769
the Umkhonto is going to be screaming

441
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,620
fast. All right. So next question

442
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,730
let's see if we can speed this

443
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,340
up a little bit. There we go. OK

444
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,240
so what do you want to do. So yeah

445
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,799
we want to erase the desk. Do we

446
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,210
want to encrypt it. I would say

447
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,889
no to that because your desktop

448
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:13,350
computer use LVM Absolutely because

449
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,179
LVM is going to allow us we've

450
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,320
learned this on the show before.

451
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,120
If you're not familiar with LVM

452
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,80
or you want to learn a little bit

453
00:16:19,80 --> 00:16:22,379
more about it it's it's amazing

454
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,659
and it allows you to run snapshots

455
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:25,860
of your entire harddrive so that

456
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,389
you can do backups on the fly without

457
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:29,279
having to shut down. Yep that is

458
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,909
perf that's one of the advantages.

459
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:32,490
So head on over to our Web site

460
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,590
category five dot tv. Do a quick

461
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,240
search for LVM and you're going

462
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,110
to get all the instructions on

463
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,100
how to do that.So we're just going

464
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,480
to do that because if we ever want

465
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,250
it it's a pain in the butt to switch

466
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,259
to it. So we should do something

467
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,279
else. Now let's do something else

468
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,919
let's keep it you know keep it

469
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,899
simple. And what does it want to

470
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,610
do. OK. Now at the top there we

471
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,29
see that it's got 240 gig. Kingston

472
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,409
not too. Can you click on that

473
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:58,289
dropdown for me Sasha. Yes just

474
00:16:58,289 --> 00:16:59,639
so we can see if it's there and

475
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,559
it's also detected. The terabyte

476
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,659
SSD. So we want to install this

477
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,309
on the M.Com too so that's the

478
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:06,839
first drive. The one that it automatically

479
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,960
selected and that is being detected

480
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,539
as the a. So install now. OK. So

481
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,190
that drive as you can see is about

482
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,369
a quarter of the capacity of the

483
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,289
VSS team. So we're going to use

484
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,940
those two together to get the most

485
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,680
blazing speed that we can possibly

486
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,630
get the most reliability it's going

487
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,690
to go really really well. Excited.

488
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,210
Yes. Can you believe that that

489
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,79
we're pretty much now just OK asking

490
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,950
you are you sure you want to continue

491
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,180
because what is this going to do

492
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,430
if you write to the disks you're

493
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,930
going to wipe out any data that's

494
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,130
on there. How much data is on there

495
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,440
right now. Well nothing nothing.

496
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:45,539
No it's a brand new system that

497
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,339
you just built. So you're absolutely

498
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,680
good to go but do keep in mind

499
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,220
if you're doing this on a preexisting

500
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,240
installation you need to think

501
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,750
twice at that point.And why is

502
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:54,839
that our time is out. There are

503
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,819
times on so that's I in New York

504
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,160
no highlight or just type in Toronto

505
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,960
because that's where we are. We're

506
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,369
just north of Toronto about 50

507
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:06,150
minutes. Barry Now you can do it

508
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,670
that way. Sure. Why is there another

509
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,430
way. Well triple click. There you

510
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,319
go. Toronto right up at the top

511
00:18:14,9 --> 00:18:16,910
on Terio Canada. I think you have

512
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,109
to actually collect. You need to

513
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,930
click with the mouse girl. Oh wow.

514
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,440
Well goodness gracious. This is

515
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,759
how we learn. Just press backspace

516
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,119
once they know they go on Toronto.

517
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,99
OK. There you go. Right. Sasha

518
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,950
is amazing with a mouse so that

519
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:38,940
this whole process to install and

520
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,410
move to is about three minutes

521
00:18:41,9 --> 00:18:42,89
it's going to take about four hours.

522
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,119
Brace yourself. Brace yourself.

523
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,950
Where are we at. OK. Click Continue

524
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,49
please. OK. You know OK English

525
00:18:52,49 --> 00:18:53,970
US keyboard. That's fine that's

526
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,109
what we're you. OK. So we just

527
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,529
can continue looking for the board.

528
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,759
So your name. Well I don't know

529
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,859
if you want to put the off. Oh

530
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,210
yeah sure I did but you know it

531
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,49
recommends recommends and then

532
00:19:07,49 --> 00:19:08,880
your computer name call it Rickman

533
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:13,799
would be fine. And then pick a

534
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,359
user name so Richmond all lowercase

535
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,380
all lowercase sound OK and then

536
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,910
under choose password I want you

537
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,180
to enter password. One two three.

538
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,720
That sounds amazingly secure that's

539
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,980
very secure. It's a combination

540
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,29
of Word and some numbers. Don't

541
00:19:33,39 --> 00:19:34,440
let's not listen to me don't do

542
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,539
it. You need to pick a password.

543
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,549
You can use password 1 2 3 for

544
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:39,809
today because we can change it

545
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:40,740
down the road when we're not on

546
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,349
the air. OK let's just do that.

547
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,220
OK. It's going to tell you that

548
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,180
it is a fair. That's nice. Set

549
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,680
password one two three. Yeah. All

550
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,759
right. Everybody you can hack into

551
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:53,279
their computer. No problem. This

552
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,450
is your home computer so you need

553
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,69
to think about this. Do you want

554
00:19:56,69 --> 00:19:57,539
to require your password in order

555
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,920
to turn it on now or do you want

556
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,910
to just make it go right to the

557
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,69
day we can just make it go right

558
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,609
to your laptop the I would say

559
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,319
absolutely you need that password.

560
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:05,549
I probably would have opted for

561
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,759
encryption as well. But because

562
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,869
this is your desktop computer I

563
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:10,849
mean unless someone steals it from

564
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,839
you. But if that happens is not

565
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:16,39
the worst thing. Let's be honest.

566
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,170
I might steal this. It's a beautiful

567
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,460
system. I know this is our new

568
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,240
broadcast. I'm the old one and

569
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,170
be like here. The new gaming day.

570
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,470
It's a pretty sweet reg.. I'm jealous

571
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,119
that I can log in automatically.

572
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,19
So is is an option. Yeah how to

573
00:20:35,29 --> 00:20:37,39
log in automatically sorry. Most

574
00:20:37,39 --> 00:20:40,150
girls it's harder than you. It's

575
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,730
because you don't like crossover

576
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,819
with the ads. Just say you know

577
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,440
I'm like mousepad.I stand up over

578
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,579
here and the keyboard I set it

579
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,339
up over here. So it's kind of I

580
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:53,319
am not down on site here.So. OK.

581
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,740
So now what is going through the

582
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,599
installation processing scene while

583
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,930
you were taking your sweet time

584
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,259
there. It actually continued to

585
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,819
install is that a dinosaur Square.

586
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,470
That's a school that is definitely

587
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,299
a squirrel. OK. I've never seen

588
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,460
a dinosaur with a tail that fic

589
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:09,109
and that long. I've never seen

590
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:11,869
a dinosaur. You've seen pictures.

591
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,140
I've seen pictures of dinosaurs

592
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,789
on green screen on different cameras.

593
00:21:17,0 --> 00:21:19,39
So high five right now. How do

594
00:21:19,39 --> 00:21:21,589
the virtual high five. Yes. Well

595
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,619
as I bleed into the next frame.

596
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:26,809
All right so that is installing

597
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:27,829
we're going to take a really quick

598
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,329
break while that continues when

599
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,400
we come back. Hopefully everything

600
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,839
is gone. Smashingly well we're

601
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,99
going to be ready to boot up into

602
00:21:34,99 --> 00:21:35,359
our brand new operating system

603
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:40,69
too. What does it call game. Keep

604
00:21:40,69 --> 00:21:42,880
a game path to game. The. Hack.

605
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,259
Is based on the next we're going

00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:48,19

622

TV.Welcome back. And tonight we

623
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,410
are digging into the installation

624
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,210
of Sasha's new operating system

625
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,579
on her gaming rig. Now Jeff you

626
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:35,720
mentioned that is question we came

627
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,190
in the chat room as we were on

628
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,79
break. Yeah. So Albuquerque Turkey

629
00:22:39,79 --> 00:22:41,480
was watching and he wanted to know

630
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,670
did he see you turn off secure

631
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,410
boot. You did not see me do that.

632
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,380
OK. What did he see. OK did you.

633
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:50,0
Did he hear me when I mentioned

634
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,849
that it has a compatibility option.

635
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,309
So yes spy on us by default is

636
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:58,940
going to allow both you EFI and

637
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,279
legacy mode options. So your devices

638
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,849
are either or. Now in the BIOS.

639
00:23:05,0 --> 00:23:07,359
You can select just legacy mode

640
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,990
which is probably what we can do

641
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,380
but by default. Fortunately for

642
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,420
us the default option is there

643
00:23:15,19 --> 00:23:17,539
and it supports legacy or you find

644
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:20,720
not not one or the other. So if

645
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,920
you have this board you're having

646
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,769
trouble what does it mean what

647
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,950
does your boot mean. So technically

648
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,509
secure boot is still enabled on

649
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:29,539
this board. Secure boot you EFI

650
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:32,390
is like technology mostly used

651
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,269
by Microsoft Windows that allows

652
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:39,140
them to make sure that the pretense

653
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,430
is that viruses can't get into

654
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,349
your bootloader. Right. Realistically

655
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,390
it keeps other operating systems

656
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,349
from running on your operating

657
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:46,789
system on your computer as well.

658
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,859
In our case we want to install

659
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,420
Linux so we need to be running

660
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,970
in legacy mode. It can be installed

661
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,980
in UAF mode but you can you know

662
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,319
it's a much more complicated. So

663
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,299
it's still enabled but we're running

664
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,220
with legacy mode as the default

665
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,170
option in the BIOS. But check those

666
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,0
out there is there are options

667
00:24:05,0 --> 00:24:07,490
there for the compatibility mode

668
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,440
as well as security settings under

669
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,0
the boot menu on this particular

670
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:12,440
motherboard and this motherboard

671
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,519
section maybe you can remind us

672
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,950
what it is that that you bought.

673
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,599
You've got your shopping list right.

674
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:18,259
You are the motherboard is the

675
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,9
aces. Is it our max. This assumes

676
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,220
I say you're wrong.I have seen

677
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,920
this and people say no you say

678
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,930
it wrong it's aces or something

679
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,869
like that. This is years ago when

680
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,279
I was building computers as an

681
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,900
OEM manufacturer. This is years

682
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,400
ago so this my first build many

683
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,930
years I've been working with HP

684
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,759
Lenovo and all that for as long

685
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,450
as I can remember. So when I worked

686
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,369
with a SUSE I talked to them on

687
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:44,809
the phone right and they called

688
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:47,49
themselves the suits.So that's

689
00:24:47,49 --> 00:24:48,559
that was how do we get to the source

690
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,319
of this. OK.So that's where that

691
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:54,710
comes from. OK. So I think that

692
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,849
answers your question Albuquerque

693
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:56,720
Turkey thank you for sending it

694
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,190
in and we're ready to get back

695
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,839
into this I believe hold on before

696
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,950
you do that. You ever finish your

697
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,29
list or at least where you could

698
00:25:02,29 --> 00:25:05,930
find the list.Oh well. Well the

699
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,960
list is what the list is on the

700
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,339
actual cat 5 slash CPQ 20:17 right.

701
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,819
Yes. Yes. That's where you would

702
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:16,220
find out how we picked all those

703
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,839
hard pieces of hardware how much

704
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,99
it cost all that kind of stuff.

705
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,869
That's how you can budget it and

706
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:23,609
do something you like.You can you

707
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,650
check out that same system that

708
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:27,859
if it goes you can use a different

709
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,599
password not one two three. Yeah.

710
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,730
But you've got to know it's password

711
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,359
one two three exclamation point.

712
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,579
Oh is that all. Well no that's

713
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,950
not what mine is right now.Your

714
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,119
e-mail password. Well as the penny

715
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,859
for for on line banking. All right.

716
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,170
So it is done. SASHA. All I need

717
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,740
you to do is click on restart now.

718
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,59
Where am I. Oh click on the mouse

719
00:25:50,59 --> 00:25:51,119
once because it's gone to sleep.

720
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,549
It's a wireless mouse. You don't

721
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:54,529
need to save power your wireless

722
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:56,990
mouse stops working and then you

723
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,779
just click it single click to to

724
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,369
make it come back. There we go.

725
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,900
Well rebooting now I wonder if

726
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:08,599
this is going to end don't worry

727
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,859
about that error message that has

728
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:14,29
to do. Looks like a soundcard driver.

729
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,549
OK. So that's not that's not a

730
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:17,839
problem for us right now. We're

731
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,930
in a live mode boot scenario. So

732
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,269
hopefully that just reboot. If

733
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:24,470
not we can do a hard boot it is

734
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,740
running off the live media. Let's

735
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,569
try it. Hang in there Jack. You

736
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:31,220
ready sir. OK. I'm going to hit

737
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,309
reset. Blue screen Blue Screen

738
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:35,720
of Death folks we just installed

739
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,640
Windows XP. OK. So what's going

740
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,140
to happen is it going to boot from

741
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,160
the hard drive. No I don't think

742
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,240
it is. I think we're going to end

743
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,549
up in our bios again because we've

744
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:50,599
never set the bootloader yes order

745
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,640
right.So now let's go into and

746
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,450
I'm taking control here for a moment

747
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,450
Sasha to boot. And you notice we

748
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,490
have no hard drives enabled but

749
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,349
we installed that on the first

750
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:07,710
drive here. The 240 gig too. OK.

751
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,309
So let's now save that. So that's

752
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,490
let's just selecting it's not turning

753
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,660
on or turning off our drives and

754
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,910
just telling your boss which drive

755
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,619
you want to boot from. And Albuquerque

756
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:19,710
Turkey for the sake of your question

757
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,500
these are the things that I was

758
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,910
talking about compatibility support

759
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,890
module. So you can actually go

760
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,29
in there and you'll see the legacy

761
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,430
ROM is selected. And then there

762
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,0
is you EFI and legacy or you F-I

763
00:27:34,29 --> 00:27:36,140
only That's the setting that you

764
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,690
were asking about. As far as you

765
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,59
EFI goes but as far as secure boot

766
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,170
right below that it has defaulted

767
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,59
to other OS and then there's also

768
00:27:46,59 --> 00:27:48,970
Windows you EFI mode. So even though

769
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,559
I didn't have to do that myself

770
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,230
it is selected before you go anywhere

771
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,819
crazy with that.Did you see on

772
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:55,990
the right hand side it has the

773
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,599
temperature. No that's who has

774
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,940
a hardware monitor. Sepia temperature.

775
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,599
Sweet. And I started see we can

776
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,630
actually go into the monitor.Let's

777
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,59
see here and watch what happens

778
00:28:10,59 --> 00:28:14,500
here. No way or motherboard's 33

779
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,769
degrees C 36 on the V.R. am when

780
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,259
we show this to you show him that.

781
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,720
Oh yeah I hear. And that's why

782
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,369
it's so quiet it has been spun

783
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,950
down to 548 rotations per minute

784
00:28:27,79 --> 00:28:29,470
while chassis fan is it 7:46 it

785
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,190
is so quiet folks you can hear

786
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,940
you Tofel and that's all part of

787
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,529
this Q fan control which you can

788
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:37,539
tweak if you want to. And that

789
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,220
basically under high load when

790
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,390
you're gaming and things are getting

791
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,980
hot it starts spinning up the fans

792
00:28:42,9 --> 00:28:44,49
keep it cooler already like if

793
00:28:44,49 --> 00:28:45,700
you're gaming everything up loud

794
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,539
anyway or you wouldn't hear if

795
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:47,769
the computer was loud. You got

796
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,480
the hands on your blasting it.

797
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,269
Absolutely. OK. So I think we've

798
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:53,259
got everything kind of set where

799
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:55,240
we want it by selecting the boot

800
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,400
the hard drive as the boot drive.

801
00:28:58,0 --> 00:29:00,39
And to be fair to Sasha I know

802
00:29:00,39 --> 00:29:01,990
I poke fun. There does seem to

803
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,39
be a bit of interference on the

804
00:29:03,39 --> 00:29:05,589
mouse. Thank you. A wireless mouse.

805
00:29:06,69 --> 00:29:06,910
So I hope that you're not going

806
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,170
to have trouble with that at home

807
00:29:09,49 --> 00:29:10,420
because how far is the mouse going

808
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,950
to be from the computer tower itself.

809
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,390
It's wireless right so you don't

810
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,170
to if it's can be 10 feet. You're

811
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,970
only about five feet right now.

812
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:20,230
But I've got another wireless mouse

813
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,339
there plus my phone plus.Right.

814
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,470
There's some things on the way.

815
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:25,29
So it's yeah it's possible that

816
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,880
that plus it's on an angle. Does

817
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,19
that matter. Yeah. Oh yes. Oh yes.

818
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,970
Oh I'm so pleased. I saw something

819
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,470
flash and I said you've been to

820
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,59
this. This looks like a black screen

821
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,950
Right up. Now video drivers are

822
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,329
not running yet because you can

823
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:46,670
see how massive everything is it

824
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,140
looks like low resolution like

825
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:49,849
a little tablet or phone screen.

826
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:53,210
So let's see if it did actually

827
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,660
load any wound any Nvidia drivers.

828
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,789
I don't see any hint that Nvidia

829
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:03,710
is there. So there are some things

830
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,69
and this is not a tutorial on how

831
00:30:07,69 --> 00:30:09,769
to get Linux up and running. We've

832
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:11,210
covered that so many times before

833
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,880
on the show. What this is Sasha

834
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,299
has now built a gaming rig. We

835
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:18,950
know it's got a beautiful and video

836
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,470
card in there. It is a super powerful

837
00:30:22,69 --> 00:30:23,509
video card that we need to install

838
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:25,640
the propriety of proprietary drivers

839
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,859
for in order to get the best performance

840
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,630
so I'll do that for you. The stuff

841
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,619
that you don't have to worry about

842
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:31,880
but know that you've got to go

843
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,779
through those steps you've got

844
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:34,99
it and she's installed the operating

845
00:30:34,99 --> 00:30:35,599
system she built the computer pretty

846
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,450
much herself from scratch from

847
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,279
the parts that Jeff and I unboxed

848
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,680
and there it is. It's up and running.

849
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,49
Sasha I think that's it.What do

850
00:30:45,49 --> 00:30:46,849
you think. I love it.So I get it

851
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:48,319
by installing the graphics drivers

852
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,609
we're going to have better resolution

853
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:51,79
we're going to have better performance.

854
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,460
It's prompting me that we need

855
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,799
a steam user. All that stuff or

856
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,819
whatever it is in the background

857
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:57,140
it's happening there. Let's look

858
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,220
at games what does it come with

859
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,549
so you can retire solitaire. So

860
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:03,420
definitely a gaming rig. DOS box

861
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,29
simulator. So that means you can

862
00:31:05,29 --> 00:31:07,279
install an old DOS games so that's

863
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,650
things like Prince of Persia. The

864
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,529
class commander key commander s

865
00:31:13,99 --> 00:31:14,450
space quest. Those things are all

866
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,49
going to run under DOS box Louris

867
00:31:17,59 --> 00:31:19,880
is another kind of gaming platform

868
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,980
so that you can you can install

869
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,930
games into the system and play

870
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,779
them. It's an easy way to find

871
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:27,819
a lot of games that are really

872
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,410
in the system MYONG minds play

873
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,150
on Linux. That is cool play on

874
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,549
Linux allows you to install Windows

875
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:37,289
games on Linux.Oh that's good.

876
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,960
Just like wine a little bit. It

877
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
uses wine and there's a back end

878
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,710
but it has an interface to allow

879
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,119
you to install the games quite

880
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,880
simply. It's not with every game

881
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,160
to be fair because Windows games

882
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,170
are built for Windows to play on

883
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,660
Linux has cut out all the complicated

884
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,180
steps to making Windows games work

885
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,609
on Linux and you don't have to

886
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:00,19
have Microsoft Windows install

887
00:32:00,19 --> 00:32:01,130
C that's good because this is our

888
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,730
first Linux can hear it. Are you

889
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,839
excited about that. Yes. So can

890
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,670
we say a little bit about why Linux

891
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,700
because I have a slight Linux bias

892
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:13,549
slightly but it's an alternative

893
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,890
Microsoft Windows and it's free.

894
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,509
You don't have to pay for licenses

895
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,690
you don't have to worry about their

896
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,839
spyware software monitoring you

897
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,970
and things like that. And any of

898
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,740
the kind of caveats that you have

899
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,359
with Microsoft Windows they don't

900
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,519
exist in Linux it's a free operating

901
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,220
system and it is developed by people

902
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,79
like ourselves who just care about

903
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,59
making something great and distributing

904
00:32:35,59 --> 00:32:37,309
it and sharing it. And that's what

905
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:38,990
Linux is. It's something that you

906
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,170
can get in on you. There's that

907
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,559
slight learning curve because the

908
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,819
interface is maybe a little bit

909
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:44,900
different but there's a lot of

910
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,700
effort that's been put into making

911
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,930
that learning curve as easy as

912
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,910
possible. I've noticed on this

913
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,349
version of Linux that it it looks

914
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:54,79
like Ubuntu maté is what it's running.

915
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,789
That is the interface so this is

916
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:58,99
Matej not. I was expecting maybe

917
00:32:58,99 --> 00:33:01,309
Gnome or possibly unity but definitely

918
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:03,410
no. So nice to see maté. I like

919
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,690
the interface a lot. Steam is the

920
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,9
next one steam we all know and

921
00:33:07,9 --> 00:33:09,19
love is something that you sign

922
00:33:09,19 --> 00:33:10,39
up for an account that you can

923
00:33:10,39 --> 00:33:12,680
buy games go all the time at home.

924
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,779
They install you tell tell us about

925
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:16,279
steam them because I'm not a gamer

926
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,150
so how does that work.Well I mean

927
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,940
when you've got steam it's all

928
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,799
encompassing as far as games library

929
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:23,180
we can make purchases. Also the

930
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,940
games that you download to crunch

931
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,730
chronology chronology of your library

932
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,819
also you know depending on whether

933
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:33,619
you're really into competing with

934
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,59
other people are you going to badges

935
00:33:35,59 --> 00:33:35,950
and stuff like that. There's a

936
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,250
whole new features to it with other

937
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,470
games. It's it's just really it's

938
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,359
a great compressed library for

939
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,740
keeping everything in one spot.

940
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:44,630
That's in a library that you can

941
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,440
just find games it's there you

942
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,970
can install them by them and steam

943
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,609
is cross-platform. That's correct

944
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:53,269
if you are not interested in taking

945
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:54,710
this route and installing Linux.

946
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,779
That's OK steam is available on

947
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:58,430
Microsoft Windows. In fact if you

948
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,750
install it on Microsoft Windows

949
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,700
and later switch to Linux it's

950
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,430
cross compatible. So you're just

951
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,789
transfer over that is is. That's

952
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,279
right. All right so that gives

953
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,599
us a good overview I think that's

954
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,10
a way to go congratulations you've

955
00:34:10,10 --> 00:34:14,360
got to get into the game. I keep

962
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,150
can see you playing the first game

963
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,929
on it. That's all I'm going to

964
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,489
tell you at this moment. Stick

965
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,559

966
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,0

here are the top stories we're

following this week. Canada's transport

1012
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:25,590
minister has told drone operators

1013
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,150
to stay away from airports after

1014
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,519
remotely piloted craft bonked a

1015
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,380

approach to Ziyang massage International

Airport in Quebec City.Minister

1018
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:38,340
Mark Garneau hasn't revealed the

1019
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,199
model of the drone but we do know

1020
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,150
that it hit a plane operated by

1021
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,940
Sky jet aviation a charter outfit

1022
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,99
that despite its name only operates

1023
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,940
turboprop aircraft. The three types

1024
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,730
it operates the King Air 100 and

1025
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,280

6 10 and 19 passengers apiece which

1027
00:37:01,19 --> 00:37:03,119
ever type was struck it came away

1028
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,800
with what Garneau described as

1029
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,380
minor damage and landed safely.

1030
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,50
There's also no news on where the

1031
00:37:10,50 --> 00:37:12,989
plane where of where on the plane

1032
00:37:13,19 --> 00:37:16,269
the drone strike is. The craft

1033
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:18,269
landed without incident. We can

1034
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,250
assume it wasn't chopped up by

1035
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,949
the plane's propellers. Local media

1036
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,659
suggest that the plane was struck

1037
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,780
about 300 or 3000 meters from the

1038
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,150
runway Oh while at an altitude

1039
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,50
of 450 meters. All concerned are

1040
00:37:34,409 --> 00:37:36,539
there for reminding Canadian drone

1041
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:38,460
operators of their obligation to

1042
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,99
fly below 90 meters and at least

1043
00:37:41,99 --> 00:37:42,599
five and a half kilometers away

1044
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,320
from air ports or face a $25000

1045
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,230
fine. Authorities hope to identify

1046
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,639
the drone pilot to remind them

1047
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,889
of those rules in strong language.

1048
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:55,980
A drone striking a propeller or

1049
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,480
being sucked into a jet engine

1050
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,730
has the potential to cause a very

1051
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,320
serious incident. Wow very scary.

1052
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,949
Yeah well I mean the fact that

1053
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:09,750
it left body damage I mean it wasn't

1054
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,670
significant but I mean that's.

1055
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,900
So are there like are. Are there

1056
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,760
drones that are smaller that are

1057
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,369
allowed to fly closer or is it

1058
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:22,349
just all drones.We're talking this

1059
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:24,570
is three three 3000 meters from

1060
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,130
the airport which I did the quick

1061
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,679
math in my head that's three kilometers

1062
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,309
folks. Yeah. And the minimum is

1063
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:33,90
5.5. So they're already not only

1064
00:38:33,90 --> 00:38:34,650
are they flying well above the

1065
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,59
height limit but they're also flying

1066
00:38:36,59 --> 00:38:37,349
very very close to an airport.

1067
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,269
Yeah. So drones can fly that high

1068
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:40,880
up like they absolutely can't.

1069
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,599
It's a bigger thrill. Yeah this

1070
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,0
wasn't clearly wasn't a teenager

1071
00:38:44,19 --> 00:38:45,449
or something like that. You know

1072
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,420
we're talking no no no this is

1073
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:48,389
we're talking about this big Drone

1074
00:38:49,50 --> 00:38:51,179
to give you just some perspective.

1075
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,280
There was a guy on YouTube who

1076
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,769
recently posted a video which was

1077
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:59,159
promptly taken down of him flying

1078
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:02,820
his phantom to to 3.5 kilometers

1079
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,829
into the air. Wow. Now keep in

1080
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:06,969
mind that regulations say we're

1081
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:08,880
only allowed to fly up to 90 meters

1082
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,889
in the air just a little bit over

1083
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:14,329
that I think he went right. Thirty

1084
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:17,190
four hundred. He was at. So because

1085
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,929
these things have first person

1086
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,30
view you know he might have a screen

1087
00:39:21,59 --> 00:39:22,980
or goggles and be able to see what

1088
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,539
the drone is seeing and so it is

1089
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:26,10
safe from that perspective it's

1090
00:39:26,10 --> 00:39:27,630
not like he's going to lose sight

1091
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,380
of it and not be able to find it.

1092
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:32,10
Right. But it's highly illegal.

1093
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:36,0
So then the actual law the rule

1094
00:39:36,0 --> 00:39:37,980
where you can't fly within like

1095
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,570
five and half kilometers to the

1096
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,780
airport that $25000 fine.Is that

1097
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,190
if there's an incident or is that

1098
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,289
if you're caught flying if you're

1099
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:49,530
caught flying as a consumer flier

1100
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,590
like if I or Jeff were refiner

1101
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,519
or drones and we were caught breaking

1102
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,139
the rules. So these are rules that

1103
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:56,730
are designed to protect aircraft

1104
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,500
and other people. So it doesn't

1105
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,699
just have to do with aircraft or

1106
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,500
airports if you're flying too close

1107
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,969
to a crowd it falls under the same

1108
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:05,969
regulations so the fine for that

1109
00:40:06,90 --> 00:40:08,489
to be caught. So nobody gets hurt.

1110
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,39
Nobody's nothing's damaged is up

1111
00:40:11,39 --> 00:40:14,190
to $3000 Canadian. OK.So that's

1112
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,829
about $4 for you American viewers

1113
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,349
or a point 0 0 0 0 Bitcoin point

1114
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,949
1 0 0 is one.It's binary. Yeah

1115
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:25,440
nothing. Chances are the twenty

1116
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,59
five thousand dollars would be

1117
00:40:27,59 --> 00:40:29,519
for like a serious incident where

1118
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,650
maybe a plane actually did crash

1119
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,139
people but like maybe they did

1120
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,710
it out today. I would hope they

1121
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,480
say they have to crash the regulation

1122
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,599
states that it's up to $25000.

1123
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:42,269
If you have endangered an aircraft

1124
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:45,329
or another person.Right. I would

1125
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:47,369
hope that if somebody flying a

1126
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:49,380
drone that crashed into a plane

1127
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:51,119
that then crashed and killed people

1128
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,250
that drone flyer I would hope goes

1129
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,590
to jail like I would hope that

1130
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,110
it's just not $25000 like I would.

1131
00:40:57,449 --> 00:40:58,860
That's an extreme case. It's never

1132
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,590
happened as far as I'm aware. So

1133
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,519
you keep a low people.Dutch electronics

1134
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,590
engineer reckons Japanese automaker

1135
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,780
Subaru isn't acting on a key fob

1136
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,659
cloning vuln t he discovered Tom

1137
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,340
women who claims to have discovered

1138
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,530
that Subaru's electronic keys don't

1139
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,719
use a random number. The rolling

1140
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:22,510
rolling code instead merely increments

1141
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,210
coats when behove says he's built

1142
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,889
a cloning device which he has made

1143
00:41:27,10 --> 00:41:29,289
available on get hub and use it

1144
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:32,110
for a 2009 Subaru Forester. He

1145
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,59
believes it would also work on

1146
00:41:34,59 --> 00:41:37,780
a 2006 Bahaa Forester. Forester

1147
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,510
models from 2005 to 2010 Impreza

1148
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:44,50
models from 2004 to 2011 the legacy

1149
00:41:44,50 --> 00:41:47,559
sedans 2005 2010 models and the

1150
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,610
outback from 2005 to 2010. His

1151
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,250
test rig only cost around $25 using

1152
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,110
a raspberry pi for much of the

1153
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,19
functionality because the key fob

1154
00:41:59,19 --> 00:42:00,909
simply increment the rolling code

1155
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:02,619
exchange between the car and the

1156
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:05,50
key. All an attacker needs is to

1157
00:42:05,50 --> 00:42:07,59
be able to be close enough to capture

1158
00:42:07,59 --> 00:42:08,679
the code used when the owner locks

1159
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:11,320
the car. Incrementing that code

1160
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,750
lets the attacker unlock the vehicle.

1161
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,889
Wow. I drive a Subi what why wouldn't

1162
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:21,969
Subaru act on that.Well it could

1163
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:23,800
be that they don't think it's a

1164
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,730
massive vulnerability I mean actually

1165
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,480
what we're talking about some vehicles.

1166
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,969
What was it 2009. We're back at

1167
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:31,900
this point. I don't think they

1168
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,130
care. I mean like if it was one

1169
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,730
of the 2000 5s are looking to go

1170
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,510
on. It's been like 13 years because

1171
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,239
it's always like you know in 2004

1172
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:42,99
the 2005 would come out so you

1173
00:42:42,99 --> 00:42:43,840
know it's been 13 years or some

1174
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,250
of them Mosul's vehicles would

1175
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,690
be off the road. It's not like

1176
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,10
it was the newer vehicles. My guess

1177
00:42:48,10 --> 00:42:49,300
is from a liability standpoint

1178
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,639
the cost factor of patching it

1179
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,190
doing a warranty recall switching

1180
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,300
out keys because you'd have to

1181
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,750
replace the keys or reprogram them

1182
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,880
but she'd have to reprogram the

1183
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,409
vehicles. The cost probably just

1184
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:01,30
wasn't significant enough or was

1185
00:43:01,30 --> 00:43:03,280
too slow.So then can you just sell

1186
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,539
something like that and get home.

1187
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:05,980
What does will get hobbies is a

1188
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,260
coating. So what what it means

1189
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,570
when he's posted it on get have

1190
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:11,469
is that is freely available. So

1191
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,639
anyone who wants to build this

1192
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:14,769
thing can download this. The instructions

1193
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:16,329
to do it right and the code to

1194
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:18,610
do it. You don't love that. And

1195
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,590
I don't want to speculate too much

1196
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,480
about Subaru not having a statement

1197
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,119
from them but knowing that you

1198
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,130
know as you know ethical hackers

1199
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,190
bring out these kinds of hey we've

1200
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:31,269
discovered this. There's a lot

1201
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:32,619
of that because people are trying

1202
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:34,460
to get the cash prize for it. Hey

1203
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,610
there are no ethical hacker prizes

1204
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,39
and so there comes a point when

1205
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:40,539
you know companies will certainly

1206
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:42,309
say no we're not doing it. Microsoft

1207
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:43,900
comes to mind recently with the

1208
00:43:44,19 --> 00:43:45,880
compromise on Internet Explorer.

1209
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:47,889
Yes. They simply say you know we're

1210
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:49,119
not worrying about the older operating

1211
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,320
systems and there was another one

1212
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,550
in the kernel itself where they

1213
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,570
say we're not going to patch any

1214
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,369
of them. It's too far into the

1215
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:55,360
kernel we're not going to touch

1216
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,190
it. We don't believe it's such

1217
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,559
a security risk as you're making

1218
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,139
that sound. Now others made me

1219
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,50
say otherwise. But I think it's

1220
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,90
that they may perceive this is

1221
00:44:07,90 --> 00:44:08,679
a May because I don't know I haven't

1222
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,210
spoken with them but they may perceive

1223
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,429
as a company that it takes a certain

1224
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:13,690
level of knowledge in order to

1225
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,960
do this type of compromise. And

1226
00:44:17,50 --> 00:44:19,119
so they don't feel as vulnerable

1227
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,429
because it's like it wouldn't happen

1228
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:23,79
to me mentality.They're such a

1229
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,269
small minority of smart people

1230
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:26,530
in the world there's no problem

1231
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,360
of people already who would create

1232
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,329
a key fob hacking device out of

1233
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:36,190
a Raspberry Pi.I'm just picturing

1234
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,110
the movie Gone in 60 seconds picturing

1235
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,250
Nicolas Cage walking around with

1236
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,79
a Raspberry Pi just like picking

1237
00:44:41,79 --> 00:44:44,170
up Shelby.I just got a whole bunch

1238
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:49,579
of super four thousand nine. Oh

1239
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,469
dear. OK. The Dutch Data Protection

1240
00:44:53,469 --> 00:44:55,750

visited. If the Windows 10 user

1248
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:14,679
is browsing the web with Microsoft's

services of course. But if users

1262
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:49,150
have not opted out. It also uses

of the OS including Windows Trenholm

1275
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,739
impro the Dutch DPA said Friday

1276
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:20,780
it has identified multiple breaches

1277
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:23,599
of the data protection law. Microsoft

1278
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,429
has compiled a point by point rebuttal

1279
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:27,99
on these points of disagreements.

1280
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,500
Wow what is to tell a tell tale

1281
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,840
about memory. What is telemetry

1282
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,929
metadata treat. Two words. Wow.

1283
00:46:39,59 --> 00:46:40,550
Yeah that's it. That's all that's

1284
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:41,840
always going to give you. So I'll

1285
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,179
give them the tracking.You know

1286
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,179
essentially I mean this is basically

1287
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,309
information that is gathered on

1288
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,860
your Windows 10 system or other

1289
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,480
systems as well. Now on Windows

1290
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,119
7 and 8 everything else but. So

1291
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:57,900
they are tracking your movements.

1292
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,99
This is how they are able to provide

1293
00:47:01,99 --> 00:47:03,510
targeted advertising to you know

1294
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,239
it's under the veil of improving

1295
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,409
the operating system because they

1296
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:08,90
might notice that hey you know

1297
00:47:08,90 --> 00:47:09,139
people running this particular

1298
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:10,789
processor are having problems opening

1299
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,159
this application so let's manipulate

1300
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:15,440
something in the code. So it's

1301
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,480
under the guise of fixing things

1302
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,579
helping improve things. But it

1303
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:21,679
is really collecting personal information

1304
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:23,869
about your usage spying on you.

1305
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,150
Right. So is there ever. Like so

1306
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,70
when they say they're using it

1307
00:47:28,70 --> 00:47:31,639
to help them. Is that actually

1308
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:33,920
at all OK. That they say that.

1309
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,699
Well that's just the guise of it's

1310
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:39,980
common to improve the user but

1311
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,710
that's not that's never the truth.

1312
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,789
Like you could disable it.There's

1313
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:45,300
always other methods and again

1314
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,730
I don't expect you know we know

1315
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,210
why Facebook gives you free accounts.

1316
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,980
We know why. You know that's exactly

1317
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:53,599
how are you going.This is leading

1318
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,119
to if there's basic telemetry and

1319
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,960
then there is full which like nothing

1320
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:01,909
ok. Would it be helpful to just

1321
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:03,300
do basic or should you do done

1322
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,610
at all.You can even opt out. But

1323
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,369
I think with some of the windows

1324
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:08,420
updates you've got to keep an eye

1325
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,880
on it because it'll reactivate

1326
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:11,480
itself because you're good and

1327
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,139
say OK with a certain I accept

1328
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:16,880
the license agreement and oh that

1329
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,320
license agreement also turn back

1330
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,269
on full telemetry. So the difference

1331
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:21,599
essentially you know the basic

1332
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,920
dilemma is the the essentials the

1333
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,300
bare minimum that they need in

1334
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,469
order to kind of keep track of

1335
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:29,239
your system and how you're using

1336
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,909
it then full telemetry and everything

1337
00:48:32,59 --> 00:48:33,710
like this is something that a technician

1338
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,320
could use to actually come in and

1339
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,0
diagnose problems on your computer.

1340
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,619
Everything about your computer

1341
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:42,800
and how you use it.Right. I got

1342
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,909
a visual. You were saying that

1343
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:45,360
if that useless box like you turned

1344
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,30
it off it turns itself back exactly

1345
00:48:47,30 --> 00:48:49,190
like that for much like that.In

1346
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,750
fact before we move on the windows

1347
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,420
club actually posted a very good

1348
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,969
tutorial for you to help you so

1349
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:58,429
that you can disable or reduce

1350
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,869
the amount of telemetry metadata

1351
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:01,420
that is shared with Microsoft.

1352
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,780
All right. That can be found on

1353
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,699
their Web site. The windows club

1354
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:08,210
dot com slash windows dash 10 dash

1355
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,860
telemetry. And that's going to

1356
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,170
give you that information. I'll

1357
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:14,929
check it out.Right. Crooks have

1358
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:16,880
come up with a strain of Android

1359
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,739
ransomware that both encrypts user

1360
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:21,230
data and locks victims out of compromised

1361
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:24,30
devices by changing pins Lucus

1362
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:25,969
the fan code. The malware researcher

1363
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:27,880
at security firm esset who discovered

1364
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,809
double double laughers said its

1365
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:31,610
payload can change the device's

1366
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,289
pain preventing the victim from

1367
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:36,980
accessing their device and encrypts

1368
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,969
the victim's data. Such a combination

1369
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:42,679
has hasn't been seen yet in the

1370
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,619
Android ecosystem. He goes on to

1371
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:47,360
explain double Lochore misuses

1372
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:49,369
Android accessibility services

1373
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:50,929
which is a popular trick among

1374
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:53,599
cyber criminals. The nest is based

1375
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,579
on a banking Trojan which means

1376
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:57,739
that account compromising functionality

1377
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:00,230
might easily be added. The Android

1378
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,179
malware spreads in the very same

1379
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:04,369
way as its PC parent as a fake

1380
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,110
Adobe Flash Player update that's

1381
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:08,309
pushed via a compromised Web sites.

1382
00:50:09,50 --> 00:50:11,760
Once launched the app for activation

1383
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,849
of the malwares accessibility service

1384
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,789
named Google Play service after

1385
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:19,219
the malware obtains these accessibility

1386
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,110
permissions it uses them to activate

1387
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,909
device administrator rights and

1388
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:25,309
set itself as the default home

1389
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:28,70
application. In both cases without

1390
00:50:28,70 --> 00:50:30,889
the user's consent double Lochore

1391
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:32,659
once planted on a compromised device

1392
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,670
creates two reasons for the victim

1393
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,980
to pay. First it changes the device's

1394
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,440
pin effect effectively blocking

1395
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,199
the victim from using it. Second

1396
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,39
double AUKer encrypts all files

1397
00:50:43,39 --> 00:50:44,760
from the data from that device

1398
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,940
is primary storage directory using

1399
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,670
the ABS encryption algorithm. The

1400
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,340
ransom has been set at a relatively

1401
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,70
modest 0.01 three Bitcoin which

1402
00:50:55,70 --> 00:50:58,340
is approximately $54. The only

1403
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,590
viable option to clean a non routed

1404
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,510
device double Walker Ransomware

1405
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:05,869
is via a factory reset. A way around

1406
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:07,579
the pin lock on the routed devices

1407
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,70
is possible if not exactly straight

1408
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:12,550
forward encrypted files cannot

1409
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:16,809
be easily recovered. Wow very scary

1410
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,519
because now it's kind of it really

1411
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:20,110
hits home. It's real phone it's

1412
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,730
really it's really real.So you've

1413
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:22,929
got to be careful of what you click

1414
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:24,760
on because this is a typical social

1415
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,500
engineering tactic of you know

1416
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,699
you've installed an app that you

1417
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:30,10
think is legitimate and it has

1418
00:51:30,10 --> 00:51:31,239
tricked you into giving access

1419
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:32,550
to certain things that probably

1420
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,639
shouldn't have given it access

1421
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:36,340
to it. It's it is just social engineering

1422
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,199
tactics used by malicious coders.

1423
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,570
And you need to really really be

1424
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:41,860
careful what you install where

1425
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,500
you get it from. You have a rooted

1426
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,190
device you need to be mindful the

1427
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,110
city is probably going to be distributing

1428
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,880
things that are not approved by

1429
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:51,159
Google and the Google Play Store

1430
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:52,960
so be very very careful. And if

1431
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,889
you're not sure what that means

1432
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:55,239
if you're not sure what a device

1433
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:56,409
means well it probably doesn't

1434
00:51:56,409 --> 00:51:58,179
affect you but you do need to be

1435
00:51:58,179 --> 00:52:00,429
aware that malicious coders do

1436
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:01,510
place things in the Google Play

1437
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:03,519
store to trick you into installing

1438
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,139
an app. That sounds great. It's

1439
00:52:05,139 --> 00:52:06,909
free and it's you know it's got

1440
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:09,489
this this and this. But why exactly

1441
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:11,440
does this chat application need

1442
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,110
access to all of my files. And

1443
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,840
that's the big tipoff. Now does

1444
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,530
doesn't mean every one of those

1445
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:20,619
apps that asks for access to everything

1446
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,199
is a bad app but you're used to

1447
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,630
it. Yeah. You usually see him you

1448
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,10
know a couple options for whatever

1449
00:52:27,10 --> 00:52:28,300
you're looking for. And there's

1450
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,409
one it's like all we know it only

1451
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:30,570
needs access to your camera than

1452
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,929
others it's everything.You know

1453
00:52:33,10 --> 00:52:34,150
watch out for and you got to get

1454
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,39
like permission for fatigue or

1455
00:52:36,39 --> 00:52:37,809
something like I just sometimes

1456
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:40,619
don't read. You got you know that's

1457
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:42,789
how they get you. Right. But also

1458
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:43,840
if they've locked me out of my

1459
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,39
phone how am I supposed to pay

1460
00:52:45,39 --> 00:52:46,389
them.Well it'll show it on the

1461
00:52:46,389 --> 00:52:48,869
screen. You've got to pay paywall

1462
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:50,750
on your phone that says hey it

1463
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:52,780
just comes in. Oh yeah. And given

1464
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,750
the fact that it's only $54 like

1465
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,869
that so it's not like it's to give

1466
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,619
us five million dollars. Most people

1467
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:00,969
get five to four bucks is just

1468
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,130
not worth going. Oh my kids photos

1469
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,130
around here. Yeah. And if they're

1470
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:06,550
going to go to like a tech center

1471
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,750
to get their phone serviced they're

1472
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:08,590
going to say oh it's a hundred

1473
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,489
hundred fifty bucks people get

1474
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,469
it cheaper than the service I'll

1475
00:53:11,469 --> 00:53:13,989
just pay it to get it a lot. Right

1476
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:15,909
out of time. Can we really quickly

1477
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:18,219
talk about the WPA hack that just

1478
00:53:18,219 --> 00:53:19,420
occurred. Yes. This is something

1479
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,159
that happened on Monday. So Sasha

1480
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,719
do you tell us about that.Absolutely.

1481
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,909
Researchers have disclosed a serious

1482
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:27,10
weakness in the WPA to protocol

1483
00:53:27,10 --> 00:53:28,389
that allows attackers within a

1484
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:31,19
range of vulnerable device within

1485
00:53:31,19 --> 00:53:32,619
a range of vulnerable device or

1486
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:35,139
access points to intercept passwords

1487
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:36,789
emails and other data presumed

1488
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:38,619
to be encrypted. And in some cases

1489
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:40,780
to inject ransomware or other malicious

1490
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,670
content into a Web site a client

1491
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,920
is visiting the proof of concept

1492
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,630
exploit is called crack short for

1493
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,519
key re-installation attacks. The

1494
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:50,829
research has been a closely guarded

1495
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:52,900
secret for weeks ahead of a coordinated

1496
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,909
disclosure that was scheduled for

1497
00:53:55,0 --> 00:53:57,70
8:00 a.m. Monday. East coast time

1498
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,889
a Web site disclosing the vulnerabilities

1499
00:53:59,889 --> 00:54:02,260
said it affects the core WPA to

1500
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,300
protocol itself and is very effective

1501
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,219
against any device including those

1502
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:09,250
running the Android Linux Mac OS

1503
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:11,530
Windows and open BSD operating

1504
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:13,780
systems. The vulnerabilities are

1505
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,579
scheduled to be formally presented

1506
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:17,349
in a talk scheduled for November

1507
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:20,110
1st in Dallas. The vast majority

1508
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,730
of existing Access Points aren't

1509
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,349
likely to be patched quickly and

1510
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:25,150
some may or may not be patched

1511
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,639
at all.Ok so that is a scary fact.

1512
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,139
So now some people are thinking

1513
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:30,550
what is all this techno babble.

1514
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,800
What is WPA to what is black. What

1515
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,449
is this exploit and what does it

1516
00:54:34,449 --> 00:54:36,190
mean to me. If you have a phone

1517
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,929
in your pocket that when you go

1518
00:54:37,929 --> 00:54:39,820
home it connects to your home Wi-Fi

1519
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,409
or you have it set up to connect

1520
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:43,599
to your office Wi-Fi your. You're

1521
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:45,369
vulnerable. Yes. Now the scary

1522
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:47,469
thing is you are also vulnerable

1523
00:54:47,469 --> 00:54:49,329
if you connect to the local coffee

1524
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:51,650
shops Wi-Fi. But here's the fact

1525
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:54,429
you have no way of knowing if the

1526
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:57,219
local coffee shop is clever enough

1527
00:54:57,519 --> 00:54:59,559
to patch their device right. If

1528
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:01,719
they do that's fantastic How will

1529
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:03,489
you ever know. I don't feel safe

1530
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:05,409
any more going to a private to

1531
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:07,599
a public hotspot. Right. And simple.

1532
00:55:08,10 --> 00:55:09,820
So what does it mean. When I connect

1533
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,519
to Wi-Fi usually that is an encrypted

1534
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:14,469
connection. I am connected to their

1535
00:55:14,469 --> 00:55:15,940
Wi-Fi hotspot and anything that

1536
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,550
I do between there between my device

1537
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,409
and their hotspot is encrypted

1538
00:55:21,39 --> 00:55:22,300
including passwords and things

1539
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,519
like that. Now throw all that away

1540
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,949
now anyone sitting in that same

1541
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:28,989
coffee shop can also see those

1542
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:30,750
things that you're doing on there.

1543
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:35,349
So it's very serious. It is. I

1544
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:36,639
mean we're not seeing this in the

1545
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,320
wild. So I should say it's not

1546
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,519
something that is actively being

1547
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,739
exploited because the ethical hackers

1548
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,289
who discovered this revealed it

1549
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:47,800
very ethically. Yes what that means

1550
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,860
is is that they let hardware manufacturers

1551
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,420
they let Google they let everyone

1552
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,179
know that is in the industry before

1553
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,619
they actually announced it publicly.

1554
00:55:56,949 --> 00:56:00,39
That means the day that they announced

1555
00:56:00,39 --> 00:56:02,230
it 7:00 a.m. that day micro tech

1556
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,550
already had a patch for all their

1557
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:05,739
routers. That's the kind of results

1558
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:07,539
that we've seen from this. So now

1559
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:09,219
we're starting to see Google is

1560
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,130
starting to work on some patches

1561
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,500
for their systems we're seeing

1562
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,269
that a lot of hardware manufacturers

1563
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:17,309
are already releasing firmware

1564
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,19
updates but you have to install

1565
00:56:19,19 --> 00:56:20,519
them. Microchip is a great example

1566
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:21,840
of a company that does it right

1567
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,800
because I can just log into the

1568
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,480
router click on Update get the

1569
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,670
latest version is done. And if

1570
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:29,130
you have a link or something even

1571
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:31,260
D-W or things like that you may

1572
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,519
need to reflash you may need to

1573
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:35,99
download a driver on your computer

1574
00:56:35,99 --> 00:56:36,210
a firmware on your computer or

1575
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:37,469
put it on a U.S. beef stick take

1576
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:39,30
it over to your router do it that

1577
00:56:39,30 --> 00:56:41,550
way or maybe through the land you

1578
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,889
have to do it otherwise your Wi-Fi

1579
00:56:43,889 --> 00:56:45,239
is susceptible you also need to

1580
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,800
delete all the Wi-Fi hotspots that

1581
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,809
you've got in your phone and only

1582
00:56:49,50 --> 00:56:50,429
start adding ones that you know

1583
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:52,929
have patched against crack. Smart.

1584
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,380
Thanks Ravi. I'm going home and

1585
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,360
going to update my firmware update

1586
00:56:57,469 --> 00:56:58,860
for you. That goes for your phones

1587
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,510
your computers as well. If you

1588
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,489
do an app update and then an apt

1589
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:04,650
upgrade on Linux you're going to

1590
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:08,489
get a WPA patch already. So make

1591
00:57:08,489 --> 00:57:09,719
sure you make that so. NEMS has

1592
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:10,889
already got the patch it's Ottery

1593
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:12,179
automatically rolled out to all

1594
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,739
of the NEMS appliances. Perfect.

1595
00:57:13,949 --> 00:57:16,460
So get it done update your computers

1596
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:20,610
folks and read a big thanks to

1597
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,320

From the Category5 TV newsroom

1606
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,570
I'm Sasheer Eckman.Thank you Sasha.

1607
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,99
This is Category Five technology

1608
00:57:41,99 --> 00:57:42,989
TV and I promised a little bit

1609
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:44,219
ago that we going to tell you a

1610
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:45,239
little bit about what's happening

1611
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:47,829
next week. The gaming rig. OK.

1612
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:48,900
I'm going to tell you two things.

1613
00:57:48,989 --> 00:57:50,519
First of all this gaming rig is

1614
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:52,650
sweet it's super fast. We can do

1615
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:55,260
really high frame rate. That's

1616
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:57,510
thing number one thing number two.

1617
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,880
What is next week the Halloween

1618
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,39
special day Halloween special.

1619
00:58:02,70 --> 00:58:05,70
What is it.Oh that's right. Because

1620
00:58:05,70 --> 00:58:06,320
Halloween is the day before today

1621
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,360
the same day every year Japh. OK

1622
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,539
so what in my mind.October 31.

1623
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,659
How do we amalgamate a sweet smokin

1624
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,820
hot virtual reality video game

1625
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:21,570
computer with our desire to celebrate

1626
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:25,380
the darkest day of the year. Well

1627
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,730
at least to dress up we're going

1628
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,469
to dress up as Starfleet officers

1629
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:29,909
from Star Trek The Next Generation

1630
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:31,440
once again. Oh you're on the show.

1631
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:33,809
And we're going to use virtual

1632
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:35,849
reality to place ourselves not

1633
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:38,190
only in the Starship Enterprise

1634
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,320
A.S.C. 17:1 but we are going to

1635
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,679
