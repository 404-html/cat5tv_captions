00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:15,120
is the Raspberry Pi killer and it's

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,539
super fast super small and it has an SAT

for tuning in to the show this has been

55
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,670
a busy week for Robby I tell you

56
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,890
yes NEMS one-point-three Hobbit was

57
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,810
always a saga on facebook ooh lots of

58
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,489
folks have and you remember about a year

59
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,190
it was a year ago I guess

60
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,510
hit me featured NEMS 1.1 that's right

61
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,290
and so we're actually going to be

62
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,900
looking at nems

63
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,810
in the next couple of weeks because it

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,880
has grown so much and by that I mean

65
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,310
like the feature set is incredible do

66
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,420
you remember names there's a lot of

67
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,230
people right now that are in the same

68
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,590
position as you where you're gone huh

69
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,730
it's fairly new oh absolutely yeah it's

70
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,680
about a year and a half old

71
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,480
yeah NEMS was released about a year and

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,790
a half ago but a year ago we really we

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,090
did a video on the the second edition

74
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,650
which was one point one then one point

75
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,959
two came out one point two point one

76
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,390
point two point three anyways what is

77
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,030
names names is Nagios enterprise

78
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,010
monitoring server and basically what

79
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,020
that means is it's an appliance that

80
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,030
goes on your network

81
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,700
that tells you if a hard drive is about

82
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,500
to crash it tells you if a computer is

83
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,690
about to fail or if you've got problems

84
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,160
with bandwidth usage from particular

85
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,140
user it tells you anything that you want

86
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,360
to monitor it shows you that it's an

87
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,920
enterprise monitoring server while

88
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,230
there's lots of those available so

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,850
what's so exciting about NEMS well it's

90
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,870
got a cool name yeah the ones that are

91
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,430
in that that's it no but as a monitoring

92
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,190
server you think about your business in

93
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,020
network and being able to monitor assets

94
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,240
within your network that is a very

95
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,590
expensive process you have to have a

96
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,450
server you have to have an appliance

97
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,160
you've got to have licensing fees that

98
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,380
cost thousands and thousands of dollars

99
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,870
per year nems is unique because it uses

100
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,300
all open source software right so it's

101
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,830
absolutely free as far as software goes

102
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,030
but then you think okay well the

103
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,000
hardware's got to be four thousand

104
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,070
dollars well no we built it specifically

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,040
to run on single board computers

106
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:16,400
starting with the Raspberry Pi 3 so

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,130
we're talking about a $35 investment I

108
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,720
mean for a basic Raspberry Pi board and

109
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,400
then you just stick MEMS on it and you

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,580
put it on an SD card and you run it

111
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,180
that's that's really I mean under a

112
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,520
hundred bucks

113
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,550
you easily have a server and people say

114
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,110
well what how reliable is it the the

115
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,770
longest-standing them server that I know

116
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,360
of was running since version 1.0 and has

117
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,680
not failed yet and it's just it's

118
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,160
continuing to run and now is running

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,840
it's actually on 1.2.3 ok soon to be

120
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,210
upgraded to 1.3 huh all that to say

121
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,590
fantastic software good over to NEMS

122
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,760
linux.com it's just like it sounds an

123
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,320
EMS linux.com and you can download it

124
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,600
absolutely free if you already have a

125
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,340
Raspberry Pi it's great you can just

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,310
deploy it on your SD card and boot it up

127
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,540
and it's ready to go otherwise you can

128
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,860
purchase a Raspberry Pi from that

129
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,350
website as well all the hardware that

130
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:13,100
you need and neat thing about NEMS 1.3

131
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,669
is that there are networks that are

132
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,669
running

133
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,919
Nagios enterprise monitoring server with

134
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,280
hundreds of computers right and it's

135
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,080
running great on a Raspberry Pi

136
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,140
it uses 5 volts of electricity and it's

137
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,300
it uses virtually no power so I like

138
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,490
there's there's no cost to operate it's

139
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,820
fantastic but some people want more

140
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,400
power

141
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,260
or so this cycle they're gonna be we're

142
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,040
gonna start seeing other hardware

143
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,880
available as as nem servers right so

144
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,710
we're gonna start seeing them as

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,820
appliances that are more powerful we've

146
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,790
got one device that we're looking at

147
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,850
that has 16 gigabytes of RAM whereas a

148
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,470
Raspberry Pi only has one gigabyte jump

149
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,540
and tonight we're actually looking at a

150
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,440
really cool device from Odroid called

151
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,760
the X u4q and it is we're gonna talk all

152
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,640
about it in just a couple minutes time

153
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,100
but it's basically the next generation

154
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,960
nem server because it's a single board

155
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,030
computer but it has two gigabytes of RAM

156
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,500
it's much much faster than the Raspberry

157
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,140
Pi we're gonna get into the specs as we

158
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,360
build it tonight

159
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,430
stick around that's gonna be fun

160
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,270
Sasha speaking of builds we finished

161
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:23,120
doing your your gaming computer has been

162
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,220
going now of course it's been it's been

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,150
a couple weeks now since you've set that

164
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:32,210
up for Dave it has been great he loves

165
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,430
it he absolutely is blown away we went

166
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,380
out and got a new Mouse so that's all

167
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,510
good okay so you just picked one up that

168
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,270
was a wireless mouse and it works better

169
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,760
yeah there was just legging issues with

170
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:49,750
the other one so this one is perfect and

171
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:52,580
then we needed a mouse pad yeah because

172
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,760
the mouse pad was was meant to be sent

173
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:59,210
with the motherboard but never actually

174
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:02,180
arrived in it right so then I remember I

175
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:05,780
was watching the show as I watched this

176
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,550
whole thing on YouTube and I was

177
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,720
watching the shona I would I was going

178
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,960
through and I was like oh well we did

179
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,580
actually receive a mouse pad because did

180
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,810
we unbox a mouse pad because I remember

181
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,900
that the motherboard was meant to come

182
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:20,090
with one exactly but I don't remember

183
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,440
ever seeing it and so when you took when

184
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,210
you started saying oh you were looking

185
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,320
for a mouse pad I said well I thought

186
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,330
that it was supposed to come with one

187
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,300
but I never did see one and we had

188
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,220
gotten into this box did you keep it no

189
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,390
well this is this is the box that sash

190
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,730
is meant to take with her but she hasn't

191
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,890
taken all the I said I said you got to

192
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,150
take all the recycling and this is this

193
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,940
is the recycling this is the stuff that

194
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:44,949
we didn't use and lo and behold Jeff

195
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:48,879
something that we never ever saw

196
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:56,659
don't see anything under there dia Sasha

197
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:59,809
mm-hmm Dave there it is beautiful gaming

198
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:01,849
mouse pad and it's a good server scible

199
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:04,099
well it's a republic again or it's a

200
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:06,499
gaming mouse pad to give you a lot of

201
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:08,119
good gameplay so it did come with one I

202
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:09,949
don't suppose you can return the one

203
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:15,229
that you spent an entire day trying to

204
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:17,929
find a perfect got one for each hand so

205
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,550
no you said the mouse didn't work now if

206
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:20,959
I recall correctly when we did the show

207
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,909
we talked about possible distance

208
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,879
because you were what like 10 feet away

209
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:28,219
potentially yes okay so is that the

210
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,519
issue in truth the mouse did work if I

211
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:33,649
was practically right on top I had to be

212
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,899
and because of the way we have our our

213
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,690
room setup Oh I mean to take a picture

214
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:41,690
every time and I haven't okay but the

215
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,959
the computer is set like a little bit

216
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,670
behind the TV to the side of it so in

217
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,899
order for the mouse to really connect

218
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,449
well you kind of had to be standing

219
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,540
right beside the TV but the TV is what

220
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:55,220
we use as our screen so so it's not that

221
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,319
the most that we got was a bad mouse

222
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,610
know because we I mean there was some

223
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:00,560
researching going on with some of your

224
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,209
components it was just a matter of the

225
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,160
distance was too far exactly in the

226
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,079
mouse itself like it clicked very well

227
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,509
it was quiet it was nice but it really

228
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:10,699
wasn't connecting proper so we're keep

229
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:12,290
it was it was affordable it was not an

230
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,880
overly expensive Mouse exact that

231
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,769
happened but what was funny is we

232
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,600
couldn't really use the computer very

233
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:18,560
well and so we had the mouse so when we

234
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
went to get the mouse we got the

235
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
mousepad then we watched the show and I

236
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,069
was like oh there is the most did I

237
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,660
mention you've got another mouse pad it

238
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:29,060
all worked out and yes we've got a

239
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,250
really like dump the boxes and see what

240
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,490
we've nest that's kind of funny that a

241
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,800
couple of extra things are there Sasha

242
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,959
now have you gotten has Dave gotten set

243
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,769
up with steam at this point you

244
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,449
mentioned that he was having trouble

245
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,370
getting his account up yes so he's fine

246
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:46,930
so he finally got his account up and

247
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,930
running and then I reset his password

248
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,670
the whole thing again because know that

249
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:54,260
I remembered what I did well knowing you

250
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,579
you changed it a password one two three

251
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,739
exclamation mark Oh with an explanation

252
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:01,319
cool Asian push okay so he's got steam

323
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,149

324
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,740

so what we're gonna do tonight is we're

326
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,000
gonna actually assemble this thing put

327
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,040
it together for you and what's included

328
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,019
in my box of the cloud shell 2 is the

329
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,459
Odroid X u4q you see this this is a SBC

330
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,279
I'm gonna call it the Raspberry Pi

331
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:22,980
killer here tonight folks and the queue

332
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:24,899
in the name stands for quiet and that's

333
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,910
that huge heatsink that you see there

334
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,759
that is gonna keep this thing cool

335
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,430
without a fan why is it a Raspberry Pi

336
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,769
killer well do you see the circuits

337
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,110
it's basically compatible as far as the

338
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:40,050
form factor goes but we've got gigabit

339
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,759
ethernet 4k video output and more we're

340
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,639
gonna talk all about that now in the

341
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,800
cloud shell case we've got a whole bunch

342
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,139
of stuff there's a USB 3 component

343
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,709
kickback cable we've got the ribbon

344
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,480
cable a bunch of screws we've got let's

345
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:57,899
see the this is really nice the front

346
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,920
panel includes a 2.8 inch TFT color

347
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:04,649
screen but it also has a backplane built

348
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,139
right into it look at that SATA and that

349
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:09,629
is for 2 SATA hard drives so that's

350
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,070
going to give us rate controller or

351
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:13,800
j-bot or whatever

352
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:17,940
do that's all built in I've got a power

353
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,190
cable I've got the Americans kind of 110

354
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,610
then we've got the 92 millimeter fan to

355
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:26,210
cool it and a 15 volt 4 amp power brick

356
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:29,970
we've got a couple of little mounting

357
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:31,710
little pieces as you can see we're gonna

358
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,070
show you all about what that does and

359
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,450
the emmc hard drive it's basically a

360
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,460
replacement for the SD card that you

361
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,380
would put in in your Raspberry Pi

362
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,990
there's our battery for the battery

363
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,820
backup for the real-time clock and then

364
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,200
the components themselves for the case

365
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,670
now you'll notice that they have a

366
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,710
little bit of a cloudy finish and that's

367
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,360
because each of these components have a

368
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,340
protective film on it now you may not

369
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,140
see it and you may not be able to really

370
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,550
easily get to it but if you get your

371
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,620
nail under there you're gonna see that

372
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,620
you can peel that right back and we need

373
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,050
to do both sides of each of these pieces

374
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,540
of plastics so that's just there to

375
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,660
protect it during manufacturing during

376
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,210
shipping itself but make sure now if it

377
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,880
is not crystal clear then you know that

378
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,710
that has some film on it so once that's

379
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,020
done they're gonna be perfectly clean

380
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,210
clear and not gonna have that cloudy

381
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,310
look to them whatsoever so now we just

382
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,890
have to kind of figure out where to plug

383
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,710
everything in but I want to do this with

384
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,720
a kingston SSD if i can so let's give it

385
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,790
a go I'm just gonna put it on this

386
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,510
mounting bracket to make it the same

387
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:38,880
size as a 3.5 million inch hard drive

388
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,430
and then I should be able to mount it to

389
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,740
the side brackets here so let's set

390
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:46,530
everything up and just a couple of

391
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,610
screws on each side should do it but we

392
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,140
need to make sure that it's lined up

393
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,090
right now I've noticed that I've

394
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,180
actually got it mounted the wrong way

395
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:58,500
around here Jeff so I need to actually

396
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,420
turn that over Robbie okay there we go

397
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,920
lined up to the backplane just fine

398
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,930
that's better I can put that back

399
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,660
together through the magic of TV we can

400
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,720
speed this up for you so it's not a full

401
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,430
hour there we go

402
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,960
now all I have to do is just plug in the

403
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,900
backplane you'll see that it just kind

404
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,490
of snaps on to the backplane there

405
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,290
because it is just an SATA hard drive so

406
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,110
that carries power and

407
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,540
the the data as well but what I'm

408
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,400
noticing here with the SSD in particular

409
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,310
with this mounting apparatus is that

410
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,760
it's not lining up so the problem with

411
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,890
that is now I can't line it up to the

412
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,350
backplane that's a problem so I do have

413
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,000
a server here that has some old 500 gig

414
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,680
hard drives in it I'm gonna pull those

415
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,870
out as we take a really quick commercial

416
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,970
break when we come back we're gonna take

417
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,370
that SSD out of there and we're going to

418
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,140
instead install physical like spinning

419
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,310
hard drives almost cuddle style

420
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,130
all right so stick around we'll be right

421
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,830
back you've got mad skills

Lynda welcome back this is category five

435
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,890
technology TV now tonight we are

436
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,460
building the Odroid cloud shell 2 with

437
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,110
the xu4 single board computer I'm

438
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,660
calling it the Raspberry Pi killer

439
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,000
because it is way more powerful than the

440
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,980
Raspberry Pi so let's fire it back up

441
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,290
and we're gonna throw these hard drives

442
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,760
in that I pulled out of an old server

443
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,950
that I've got here these are just 500

444
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,660
gig barracudas so we'll just remove them

445
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,150
from the mounting apparatus and just

446
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,100
take this SSD out now I do want to do

447
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,930
the SSD thing so in a couple of moments

448
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,240
I'm gonna show you a bracket that we

449
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,700
could use that would allow me to use my

450
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,320
SSDs in this system but you can see that

451
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,300
the normal hard drive line up really

452
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,800
really well and so we're gonna go that

453
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,240
route just for tonight for the sake of

454
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,190
time and for the sake of the

455
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,930
demonstration so that looks good it's

456
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,750
gonna work with this backplane just fine

457
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:21,630
so we'll put these drives in now this

458
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,160
particular unit the cloud shell to the

459
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,600
case it

460
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,210
includes the back plane that has raid

461
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,160
rate capabilities so by putting two hard

462
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,050
drives in here I can set up a mirror I

463
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,420
can make it so that these two computer

464
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,250
these two hard drives will have an exact

465
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,470
image of one another so that if one of

466
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,110
the hard drives crashes I still have the

467
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,670
data so we should be able just to plug

468
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,490
that right in now these ones line up a

469
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,620
lot better than that then that SSD with

470
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,840
the just kind of the included mounting

471
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,420
plate so if we just line that up and

472
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,590
give it a little push should be nice and

473
00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:01,620
snug there we go okay all right looking

474
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,320
good not too tough to put this thing

475
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,360
together as a Jeff know so simple Sascha

476
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,950
do you appreciate the ease I'm just

477
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,170
gonna stick a couple of screws in here

478
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,020
too just to hold that together that's

479
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:16,290
just for the side of the the faceplate

480
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,180
itself a little quicker and easier to do

481
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,940
it this way then the build that we've

482
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,410
had to do so this is the 92 millimeter

483
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,400
fan I'm just going to mount that here

484
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,840
and one of the things you're gonna

485
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,220
notice I'm just gonna put in three

486
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,950
screws you're gonna understand that a

487
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,870
couple of minutes time but essentially

488
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,250
when you're putting the fan on here we

489
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,780
just want three screws and the other

490
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,970
thing that's important is we observe the

491
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,380
airflow direction there's a little arrow

492
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,670
here that shows me that it's blowing out

493
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,440
the back of the computer that's

494
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,830
important we want to draw the hot air

495
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,090
out of the chassis and blow it out now I

496
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,970
can plug it directly into the board but

497
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,250
it did include a current limiter here

498
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:53,220
and that is actually going to slow down

499
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,930
the fan make it quieter because it has a

500
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,450
lower spin speed so I would recommend

501
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,980
that we install that first and then

502
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,810
we're gonna monitor the temperatures and

503
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,610
and see if we need to remove that it's a

504
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,010
nice easy thing to undo if we need to

505
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,090
with hard drives spinning hard drives

506
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,790
like this we're gonna generate a lot

507
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:11,160
more heat than we would with an SSD so

508
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,350
the SSD component when I upgrade to that

509
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,300
is going to run a lot cooler so I'm

510
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,880
happy to use that limiter I may need to

511
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,600
remove that with these hard drives so

512
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:24,300
the Odroid xu4 Q is right there look at

513
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,730
that board it is just like a Raspberry

514
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,710
Pi as far as form factor goes in this

515
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,050
case just kind of snaps together as you

516
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,600
can see

517
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:37,040
and there we go so now we're gonna

518
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,809
actually mount the Odroid itself but I

519
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,850
did notice that I've missed a couple of

520
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:44,540
films here so we do need to make sure

521
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:46,400
that we've got all of those removed just

522
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,920
watch those little components they kind

523
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,630
of got set aside and I missed it so now

524
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,179
we're just gonna put these these little

525
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,620
connectors these riser connectors onto

526
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:56,030
these little components and it's a

527
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,309
little confusing if you don't have a

528
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,200
visual to see you know the manual makes

529
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:02,120
it a little difficult to see so I hope

530
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,130
that this helps you to be able to mount

531
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,070
this before I mount it I noticed that

532
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,170
there's an emmc input which is going to

533
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,020
be my hard drive so this is a jack for

534
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,970
the hard drive itself this replaces an

535
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,000
SD card so it's much more reliable much

536
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:19,460
faster and it's gonna give us a lot of

537
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,630
life so we just kind of snap that on I

538
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,340
would recommend that you do buy that

539
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,110
it's sold separately but it's going to

540
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,800
be more reliable than an SD card for

541
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:30,200
sure and a lot faster so now I can mount

542
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,370
the board and keep in mind it's a little

543
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,410
backwards to what you would expect it

544
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,550
actually hangs the board hangs so it's

545
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,350
not mounting from the bottom it's

546
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,120
mounting from the top of the board

547
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,490
so I mentioned that this is the

548
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,980
Raspberry Pi killer it is an 8 core

549
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:46,059
single board computer Jeff really 8

550
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,380
cores it's got 2 gigabytes of ddr3 RAM

551
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:50,840
make sure you keep your maker kit handy

552
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,640
by the way here I actually needed to

553
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,320
pull a couple of screws because there

554
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,230
were a couple screws missing with 8

555
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,980
cores 2 gigabytes of ddr3 RAM this thing

556
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,809
runs up to 2.0 gigahertz which makes it

557
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,300
more than twice as fast as a Raspberry

558
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:06,710
Pi 3 their latest version and we know

559
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,929
that the Raspberry Pi is not bringing

560
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,150
out a new version any time soon so this

561
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:13,970
is the next gen and definitely you know

562
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:16,340
this gets you back on top of the single

563
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,540
board computer market so it just kind of

564
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,250
snaps in there and then we need to just

565
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,100
apply this ribbon cable which we're

566
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,080
going to Bend just to make it so that it

567
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,520
connects the way that we want it to I'm

568
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,429
going to just fold the cable a little

569
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,950
bit here so that it it looks clean and

570
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:33,770
it's not kind of just draped over

571
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:36,110
everything we need it to be able to

572
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,540
reach the board so

573
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:42,559
just connect that in it's like an old

574
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,630
IDE cable takes me back oh so then

575
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,309
that's gonna go into the the front panel

576
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,130
what that's gonna do is it's going to

577
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,809
provide power to the circuit board so we

578
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,000
don't need to have separate power for

579
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:55,100
the X X you for at all

580
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,160
it also provides the signal to the

581
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,809
screen on the front panel so and then

582
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,179
some other communication as well so but

583
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,790
the screen is actually a color computer

584
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:07,640
screen and every every bit of the signal

585
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:10,520
goes through this cable so now the final

586
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,809
kind of step here is we need to connect

587
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,160
the SATA controller but first I need to

588
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:18,679
make sure now you see this little dip

589
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,590
switch here that's gonna select between

590
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,530
the emmc and the SD card and I want to

591
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,650
leave that out as you can use either or

592
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:30,230
you can choose which one you want to use

593
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:32,450
here is a selector a dip switch for the

594
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,040
RAID controller we're gonna zoom in a

595
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,290
little bit on this so that you can see

596
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,320
so this allows me to select raid 0 raid

597
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,840
1 span or j-bot and PM PM is basically

598
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,059
default mode like normal harddrive mode

599
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,440
so independent drives that's the mode

600
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:47,660
that I'm going to use so both switches

601
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,660
are going to beep off so then we plug in

602
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:52,100
this USB cable which is actually USB 3

603
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,520
that's another advantage to the Odroid

604
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:58,669
Xu 4 is that it has USB 3 whereas the PI

605
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,750
has USB 2 and it's very very slow this

606
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:04,970
one is very very fast and it's USB

607
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:08,330
Attached or scuzzy so it's very very

608
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:12,110
fast compared to typical USB connected

609
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:16,360
hard drives so just simple slide and

610
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,360
click finish putting this thing together

611
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:23,380
look at that Wow

612
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,789
now I mentioned this battery here this

613
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,590
is sold separately but this makes it so

614
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:28,720
that if you unplug the power from the

615
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,610
Odroid it will remember the time and

616
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,470
date I think that's important so for the

617
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,570
extra couple of dollars that it cost to

618
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,639
buy a battery for it I just look at the

619
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,600
RTC battery or real time clock and that

620
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:40,299
just kind of goes in there and I just

621
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,250
push it aside that just helps with that

622
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:45,850
and that's pretty much all there is to

623
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,919
it so slide the cover on there and now

624
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,960
it's still you know nothing's quite

625
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,840
locked into place yet but look at that

626
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:58,179
absolutely beautiful now the bottom of

627
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:00,759
this chassis is wide open so check this

628
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:02,620
out underneath we've got a lot of

629
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,909
airflow but we need to be mindful of

630
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,500
that if you're gonna set it on a shelf

631
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:07,120
or something like that you know you know

632
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,070
you need to be mindful that it is wide

633
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,840
open on the side is where you plug in

634
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,090
the power and again this is a 15 volt

635
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,950
power cable and it powers everything you

636
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:18,610
don't need to have separate power for

637
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,409
the Odroid now the final piece is to

638
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,149
lock the cover in place with this little

639
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:24,629
guy this is why I didn't want to have

640
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:27,580
that third and the fourth screw in the

641
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:30,700
chassis fan because now with that lock

642
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:35,280
in place screw in that final screw and

643
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,310
that's all there is to it now

644
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:41,550
we're done everything's locked cool good

645
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,270
and solid beautiful little rig I love

646
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,190
the look of it

647
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:47,640
now you can get one of these at camp 5

648
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,680
TV /c s 2 for cloud shell 2

649
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,870
of course you can also pick up the board

650
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:56,160
itself cat 5 dot TV /x u4q you're gonna

651
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,360
need both of those components in order

652
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,580
to put this thing together absolutely

653
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,320
awesome now a couple of other upgrades

654
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,570
that you could get for this if you want

655
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,880
Jeff I love the fact that it's crystal

656
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,880
clear yes love the love the look of it

657
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,970
so I went and picked myself up a 92

658
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,000
millimeter replacement chassis fan that

659
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,710
has built-in LED lighting yeah so it's

660
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,880
gonna make this thing glow really really

661
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,470
cool one of the things I was

662
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,260
disappointed with there is that I

663
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,940
couldn't plug in my kingston SSD right i

664
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,950
would like to have this for a couple of

665
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,210
reasons first extremely cool no moving

666
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,640
parts it's not going to generate heat

667
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,430
too it's very very reliable there are

668
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,990
again no moving no moving parts so if it

669
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,940
gets bumped or if it's you know just

670
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,470
spinning all the time 24/7 it's not

671
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,170
going to have that wear and tear of a

672
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,750
physical spinning hard drive and they're

673
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,900
just just ultra reliable ultra fast and

674
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:48,720
I can set them up in a RAID one what

675
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:51,780
nice so in order to do that of course

676
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,610
the included chassis mount was not meant

677
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,500
for a backplane not going to do it for

678
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,200
you so I picked up one of these which

679
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,970
I'll post a link below in the comments

680
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,330
actually picked up two of these I should

681
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:05,220
say okay for my drives so what this is

682
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,530
is a little different from the one

683
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,450
that's included and just a simple little

684
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:12,030
upgrade it looks like the back of the

685
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:16,740
hard drive right an SATA hard drive you

686
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:19,440
slip the SSD in here oh and it snaps in

687
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:23,340
there we are it's done and now it has

688
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,230
the exact form factor to spec of an SATA

689
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,990
hard drive so now it will fit that

690
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,940
backplane so my next upgrade is to now

691
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,250
switch to these Kingston SSDs I've got a

692
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,960
couple of DC 400s which are really

693
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,600
reliable right enterprise drives

694
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,390
beautiful drives and that's going in my

695
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,760
Odroid case nice so what can you do with

696
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:44,580
this what can't you do with it well X

697
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,650
media server okay gaming nice you want

698
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,600
to do some retro gaming on here turn

699
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,970
this into a retro gaming system

700
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,350
imagine with eight cores two gigs of ram

701
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,210
how much more powerful that's gonna be

702
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,710
the new Raspberry Pi right you want to

703
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,250
build your own network attached storage

704
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:00,750
device an ass now the one thing I'm

705
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,590
noticing is that there's no peripheral

706
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:06,899
plugins it's for what anything like well

707
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,490
I'm not seeing oh it's on the silent

708
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:11,549
yeah I don't even see right over here

709
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,299
we've got USB and we've got HDMI 4k

710
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:15,120
output

711
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:17,639
totally we've got 10 over 100 over 1000

712
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,889
Ethernet there is no built-in Wi-Fi but

713
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:21,870
you can plug one into the USB okay I

714
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:24,389
would say probably put it internally

715
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:27,210
because there are USB 3 ports inside the

716
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:28,679
chassis so you can put that in there to

717
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,269
hide it and not to use up one of your

718
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,879
external ports here see I was paying

719
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:36,450
attention to the bill that wasn't an SD

720
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:37,950
port here for SD cards micro SD and so

721
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,870
on and of course because it's USB you

722
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:43,049
could always if you wanted to grab the

723
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:45,120
USB 3.0 from the inside here and run a

724
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:47,250
cable at the back or out the side there

725
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,129
are some ports here yes and have it go

726
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:52,409
to a USB 3 hub and then okay multiple

727
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:54,000
USB 3 ports that are powered right so

728
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:56,370
you can do all that kind of stuff it's

729
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,129
built to be I mean it's a it's it's a

730
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:01,649
DIY nice box nice how do you like that

731
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:03,539
so if you in Nass being network-attached

732
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:06,509
storage you can set this up as a new

733
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:08,490
server a nice economical server for your

734
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:10,379
network be it business or very nice when

735
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,210
I say Plex that's a media server so that

736
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:15,480
you can watch TV shows on any of your

737
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:17,909
devices it's like a DIY build your own

738
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,169
Netflix server I love it and you can

739
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:21,299
just lo every day we're on Plex

740
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:23,820
beautiful but Plex through a Raspberry

741
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:25,980
Pi now this is two to three times faster

742
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,860
I know with better specs better

743
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,860
performance and real hard drives for

744
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:36,269
storage yes beautiful check that out cat

745
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:40,590
5 dot TV /x u4q for the circuit board or

746
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:42,960
cat 5 dot TV slash CS 2 for the case

747
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,490
itself we've got some other components

748
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,870
listed there in the description below

749
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:49,169
post your comments let us know what you

750
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:51,840
think and Sasha you built that really

751
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:54,330
really fast the magic of television is a

752
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,480
beautiful thing I love that we can do

753
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,480
that

754
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:01,859
all right here are the stories were

their arrival Qualcomm some iPhone users

759
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:17,339
are fuming over the new letter i bug tor

760
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:19,950
has been leaking users real IP addresses

761
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:22,259
and australia's a multi-million dollar

762
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,079
broadband network is under attack from

763
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:26,959
cockatoos these stories are coming right

764
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,549

I'm Sasha Rickman and here are the top

787
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:29,789
stories were following this week

788
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:32,220
Broadcom has confirmed its multi-billion

789
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:34,980
dollar bid for Qualcomm revealing more

790
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,559
details of the 130 billion dollar

791
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,110
all-cash and shares offer to buy out its

792
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:42,149
rival chip maker both Qualcomm and

793
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:44,429
Broadcom are specialists in

794
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:46,529
system-on-chip products putting arm

795
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:49,529
compatible silicon into various items

796
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:51,869
such as smartphones and the wildly drawn

797
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:54,299
world of the Internet of Things which

798
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:56,940
all chip makers regard as the future of

799
00:31:54,299 --> 00:32:00,629
chip sales and manufacture broad coms

800
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:03,330
offer comprises $70 per share which we

801
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:05,690
now know is a fact and is made up of 60

802
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:08,820
dollars in cash and $10 in stocks

803
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,889
Broadcom CFO Thomas Kraus said we look

804
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,080
forward to engaging immediately in

805
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:15,169
discussions with Qualcomm so that we can

806
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,200
sign a definitive agreement and

807
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:21,600
completes this transaction expeditiously

808
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,549
it's a bold move by Broadcom Qualcomm on

809
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,590
the other hand has sued Apple attracted

810
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:29,340
the interest of antitrust authorities in

811
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:31,830
America and earned the an enemy of Intel

812
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,929
on the flip side it's not only

813
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,820
profitable but is in the middle of its

814
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:41,100
own multi-billion dollar buyout of

815
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:43,440
arrival so the Internet of Things is

816
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,200
definitely 100 percent the future of

817
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,179
this actual product itself right well

818
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,639
sure yeah the Internet of Things being

819
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,980
like connected devices and and so on

820
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:56,039
right so if you're a chip manufacturer

821
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:59,490
you want to be in on that right ok so

822
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:02,249
what exactly is a system on a chip like

823
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,619
it's well I would imagine I mean we're

824
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:06,149
talking about chips with firmwares so

825
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:09,299
that the software is actually running on

826
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:12,499
the circuit on the chip itself but these

827
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:16,279
guys I mean Broadcom does I think it's

828
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:19,529
like broadcast circuits and chips and

829
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:22,289
Qualcomm does the modems for these

830
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:23,580
devices so various different you know

831
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:25,590
different needs you know you think of an

832
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,179
iPhone and you think about a specific

833
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,769
phone you don't think about the fact

834
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,400
that each little chip is made by

835
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:31,740
different many

836
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,200
factures Broadcom being one qualcomm

837
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,120
being another mm-hmm right exactly but I

838
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,650
you know what my question is if Qualcomm

839
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,230
is doing so well and is actually a good

840
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:43,260
rival why bother is Qualcomm doing so

841
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,950
well well are they they're profitable

842
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,610
they say hey seventy bucks a share

843
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:51,120
that's the offer

844
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:53,580
okay so Qualcomm is profitable right

845
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,090
right consider the dispute that they've

846
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:58,860
had since before January with Apple like

847
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,910
their one of their biggest customers and

848
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,720
obviously one of the biggest

849
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,950
manufacturers in the world as far as

850
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,250
mobile devices and and that kind of

851
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,330
thing goes so they're profitable yeah

852
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,520
we're making money we're in the black

853
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:15,030
but we're not if they're ninety percent

854
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,240
down on previous years so their their

855
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:20,610
profit right is way down compared to

856
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,679
previous years so no they're not doing

857
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,149
well they're they are profitable they're

858
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,880
still making money but they're on the

859
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:32,159
decline right okay Wow so you know the

860
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,130
the thing with that you know why would

861
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,140
Broadcom be looking at buying Qualcomm

862
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:39,810
well it's it's an opportunity they're

863
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,610
doing poorly right now right and as far

864
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:43,110
as that goes and I think it really all

865
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,399
surrounds the Apple thing I shouldn't

866
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,929
say that they're doing poorly they're

867
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,669
not then they have other customers but

868
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:49,290
the whole thing with Apple is they

869
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,149
they've got patents that they're just

870
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,790
you know Apple is disputing the fees

871
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:55,320
that go along with those patents and

872
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,909
Qualcomm is fighting them and they're

873
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,590
suing each other and there's all these

874
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,050
lawsuits going back and forth right so

875
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,730
it makes me wonder if there's a

876
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:03,930
perspective on it that you know broke up

877
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,970
sitting there going well if they win

878
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:09,420
this we get access to all of you

879
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:11,700
earnings if Apple or oh if they win the

880
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,710
buyer this is it here's the thing so

881
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,660
imagine their their stocks of their

882
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,920
stocks went down yep Qualcomm because of

883
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,220
the lawsuit and everything else so

884
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,080
they're doing poorly that way then along

885
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,140
comes Broadcom in this perfect moment

886
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,210
and like a vulture says okay we'll give

887
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,240
you this unimaginable like the biggest

888
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,670
buyout in tech ever 100 billion dollars

889
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:37,980
and in order to take over your company

890
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:40,590
so if they say yes now Broadcom buys up

891
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,470
all those the patent portfolio it now

892
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:44,540
owns it and settles the

893
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,160
with Apple fixes that relationship

894
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,570
because Apple is already on the fence

895
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,980
about their relationship with Qualcomm

896
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,480
and saying you know maybe we want to

897
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,390
just sever this relationship altogether

898
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,890
so if they say yes if Qualcomm says yes

899
00:35:53,390 --> 00:36:00,980
to the buyout now Broadcom can fix

900
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,599
things with Apple and and redeem that

901
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,420
whole relationship and become this

902
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,030
bigger entity now if if Qualcomm says no

903
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:12,349
however the stocks go back down the

904
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:15,200
stocks plummet right and Apple says you

905
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:16,550
know what we still want out yeah now

906
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,650
that's not a sure thing this is just a

907
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:21,260
theory but you know what what timing

908
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,430
what absolute timing if you're Qualcomm

909
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,950
you pretty much don't have a choice you

910
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,480
kind of don't I kind of feel that way

911
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,020
it's like okay we really need to take

912
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,390
this otherwise we're done yeah like our

913
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,460
stocks are way down now their stocks

914
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,680
rose when they offer came right like

915
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,930
they're like big-time and are continuing

916
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,000
to rise at a slower pace but you know

917
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,890
it's it's happening so as soon as they

918
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,570
say yes it's gonna be a good thing for

919
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,040
you know for everything involved but if

920
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,270
they say no then it's gonna drop right

921
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,070
back down yeah exactly

922
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:52,070
it's all in relation to Broadcom I think

923
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:53,270
wow thank you well things that happen

924
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:57,410
behind the scenes

925
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:59,839
speaking of Apple some iPhone users have

926
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:03,050
been left frustrated after an update to

927
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:05,300
the iOS operating system curiously began

928
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,180
to autocorrect the letter I to a capital

929
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:11,150
a with a question mark the affected

930
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:14,180
version of iOS 11.1 is available on

931
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,830
iPhones and iPads a technology reporter

932
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,080
shared his frustration on Twitter saying

933
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,119
I have a one thousand one hundred and

934
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,310
fifty dollar telephone they can't read

935
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,930
the letter I

936
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,670
Apple has outlined a temporary fix for

937
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:27,530
the problem on its website the fix

938
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:30,680
involves editing the keyboard settings

939
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,960
so Anna in iOS so that's the right

940
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,470
character either an upper or lowercase I

941
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,359
is used Apple has said that the issue

942
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:42,410
will be fixed in a future software

943
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:46,490
updates and not all iOS 11.1 users have

944
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:48,980
been affected Wow Canadian the Canadian

945
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:50,450
it's not a bug it's a Canadian upgrade

946
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,050
you wouldn't think that would be a

947
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:55,670
simple patch just fix it upload it and

948
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,730
be done with it in one day

949
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,250
right right you think you would think

950
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:04,430
that but it could perhaps it's it's not

951
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,780
I'm kind of envying Android right now

952
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,250
where if you have problems with your

953
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,630
keyboard you just install a different

954
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,580
keyboard yeah

955
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:13,940
Apple is like locked in it's like you're

956
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:18,140
on Apple you can't change things so it

957
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:21,440
cause an autocorrect issue like that bad

958
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,870
dictionary virus not a virus I don't

959
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,360
think that'd be pretty unlikely I mean

960
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:27,920
it could be like a disgruntled employee

961
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:31,220
who you know having tried to delete the

962
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,920
president's Twitter account and so

963
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,660
decided to inject strange character it

964
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,360
sounds to me like this was an update to

965
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,670
iOS 11.1 that was meant to introduce all

966
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,400
these new emojis so maybe maybe maybe

967
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:46,160
the emot-- like I think about I and then

968
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,110
a stray or a and then a strange question

969
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,360
mark character this kind of seems to me

970
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,830
like maybe a high ASCII issue or

971
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,780
something like that so you know the

972
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,880
programmer in me thinks maybe that you

973
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,740
know it's trying to output a Unicode

974
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,410
character or something like that so what

975
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,720
that means is maybe just that key that

976
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,980
particular autocorrect got corrupted or

977
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,320
changed to something that it shouldn't

978
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,580
have been and so it's correcting

979
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,160
everything because as you type it

980
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,170
replaces words so imagine every time you

981
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,640
press I and hit space it replaces it

982
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:30,430
with a would you be fine unless you're

983
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:30,430
trying to type in your password it's an

984
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:44,210
it seems a little bit too good to be

985
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:46,160
true as far as humor Macs and Linux

986
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,960
versions of the Tor anonymity browser

987
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,360
just received a temporary fix for

988
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,120
critical vulnerability that leaks users

989
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,210
IP addresses whenever they visit certain

990
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,070
types of addresses turmoil as the flaw

991
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,560
has been dubbed by its Discoverer is

992
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:03,650
triggered when users click on links that

993
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,740
begin with file colon slash slash rather

994
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:08,359
rather than the more common HTTP colon

995
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,549
slash slash and eight

996
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:14,239
ttp equal and slash slash address

997
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:16,730
prefixes when the tor browser for Mac OS

998
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,369
and Linux is in the process of opening

999
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:22,039
such an address the operating system may

1000
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:26,509
directly connect to the remote host by

1001
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:28,819
bypassing tor browser on Friday members

1002
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:32,029
of the Tor project in issued a temporary

1003
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:34,130
workaround that plugs the IP leak until

1004
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,869
the final fixes in place updated

1005
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:39,140
versions of the browser may not behave

1006
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:42,380
properly when navigating to file colon

1007
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,749
slash slash addresses they said both the

1008
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,390
windows versions of tor and tails as

1009
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:50,420
well as the sandboxed tor browser that's

1010
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:52,039
in alpha testing aren't vulnerable tor

1011
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,960
statement Friday said that there's no

1012
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:56,960
evidence that the flaw has been actively

1013
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,150
exploited on the internet or dark web to

1014
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,430
obtain the IP addresses of tor users of

1015
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:03,230
course the lack of evidence doesn't mean

1016
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,089
that the flaw wasn't exploited by law

1017
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,249
enforcement officers private

1018
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:09,980
investigators or even stalkers for that

1019
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:12,140
matter and now that a fix is available

1020
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,940
it will be easy for advert adversaries

1021
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:18,829
who don't know about the vulnerability

1022
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:21,529
before to create working exploits anyone

1023
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:23,480
who relies on Mac or Linux versions of

1024
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:26,210
the tor browser to shield their IP

1025
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,680
address should update as soon as

1026
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:30,140
possible and be ready for the

1027
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,680
possibility however remote that their IP

1028
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:36,289
addresses have already been leaked hmm

1029
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,499
wow very tool that's meant to protect

1030
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:43,039
your IP and identity yeah

1031
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:46,190
boy sure I have used and understand the

1032
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,650
prefix HTTPS right would an HTTP but a

1033
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:52,880
secure website exactly unsecure website

1034
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:55,579
I've never typed in file colon slash

1035
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,170
slash but you could click on links on a

1036
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:00,470
website that would take you there right

1037
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:01,940
of course but like I don't understand

1038
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,339
why you would even need to use something

1039
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,109
like that like what's the ok so file

1040
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:09,019
colon slash slash typically refers to

1041
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:13,640
files on your own hard drive so a

1042
00:42:09,019 --> 00:42:16,609
website for example if I was creating a

1043
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,700
tutorial on how to access network shares

1044
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:20,900
I could tell you in my tutorial on my

1045
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,349
blog

1046
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:31,700
in order to access your server at IP

1047
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:33,829
address 192.168.0.1 i 2.16 a ton so i

1048
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,530
could use it in a tutorial and file

1049
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:39,530
colon slash slash tells my browser do

1050
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:41,720
this on the local network or it might be

1051
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,880
like a local file for some you know for

1052
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,789
some reason or you know a local uploaded

1053
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,099
image or something so there are cases

1054
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:52,309
where it could be needed or where it is

1055
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:55,910
legitimately used I know like docu vici

1056
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:58,880
for example will convert local network

1057
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,799
share addresses into links so that if

1058
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,039
I'm on my personal network and I click

1059
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:06,980
on that link it will take me to my local

1060
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:10,579
internal server so that's a file colon

1061
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:12,650
slash slash link fairly uncommon but in

1062
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:15,349
the you know in the wild once this

1063
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:17,270
exploit is now known people may in fact

1064
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:19,220
put those links on websites

1065
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:21,740
we're not even links but JavaScript

1066
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,020
redirects for example to exploit the

1067
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:28,549
person's IP address yeah now that the

1068
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:30,020
fix is available now people are like you

1069
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:33,349
know what happens when a fix comes out

1070
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:36,740
is everybody who is malicious says oh

1071
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:38,690
that's how I can get people people's IP

1072
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,900
addresses right now there's a fix I know

1073
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,609
how to exploit that browser ok now for

1074
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,619
people they use tor browser they

1075
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:47,930
obviously don't want their IP addresses

1076
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:49,309
to be exposed so what happens in this

1077
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:50,960
case now where their IP address is

1078
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:53,569
exposed is there anything they can do

1079
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,190
what can you do if your IP is exposed

1080
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:57,109
right like your ISP your internet

1081
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:00,020
service provider controls your IP

1082
00:43:57,109 --> 00:44:02,029
address think of the IP as and it stands

1083
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,220
for Internet Protocol it's your your

1084
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:06,500
your phone number for your computer

1085
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,480
right or your network so when you go to

1086
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,029
Google and you type in a search it

1087
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,430
responds back to your computer with the

1088
00:44:11,029 --> 00:44:15,200
results and that is done through your IP

1089
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,930
address and that's very very important

1090
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,000
and it generally you know if you're on

1091
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:21,980
cable or there fiber or anything like

1092
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,510
that generally doesn't change and if it

1093
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,760
does is very infrequent like every

1094
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:27,710
couple of years I no cable cable

1095
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,119
internet here in Canada it might be

1096
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,029
every couple years you'll see your IP

1097
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,420
address changed when they rolled out

1098
00:44:31,029 --> 00:44:34,410
ipv6 the IP address is chained

1099
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,849
and I think that's the only time that

1100
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:40,710
I've had a change in four years let's

1101
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:42,630
see with mine if I restart my modem

1102
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:45,299
mm-hmm my IP address changes so you're

1103
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,859
on DSL no I'm on cable you're on cable

1104
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:47,910
and are you sure it changes your puppy

1105
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:50,640
changes yep

1106
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:52,859
so some ISPs do that yeah because

1107
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,030
there's a pool of IP addresses there's

1108
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:55,200
no guarantee that it's going to change

1109
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,150
when you restart your router no

1110
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,760
certainly DSL is a case where it's

1111
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:01,920
probably going to change because it it

1112
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,900
reconnects over pppoe with your username

1113
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,520
and password and then gets a new IP

1114
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,950
address right every time you restart

1115
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,210
your router or your modem so it's a

1116
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:12,030
little bit different but with internet

1117
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,890
on cable it quite often it keeps the

1118
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,230
same IP rights and that's what shocked

1119
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,579
me is when I saw that mine reset I was

1120
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,250
like yeah that's interesting because I

1121
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:22,049
got it with my ISP about it and I'm like

1122
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,460
why did this happen they're like oh it's

1123
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:25,530
a security feature they have in a

1124
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:28,230
business though in a business typically

1125
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:30,450
you're gonna be sitting on a static IP

1126
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,609
addict yes that means that phone number

1127
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:34,890
of your network never changes so if

1128
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:37,619
somebody is exploited on that IP address

1129
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:41,630
you are never going to lose that IP

1130
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:44,040
address it is now identifiable to you

1131
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:46,079
good types if you're interested in

1132
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,790
knowing what an IP address reveals

1133
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,010
here's a little trick for you go to

1134
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,440
Google okay so just go to your favorite

1135
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,640
Google search engine and the reason I

1136
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,559
say Google is because they have a tool

1137
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,049
in the search instead of doing a search

1138
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:59,760
just type in IP so that stands for

1139
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:02,970
Internet Protocol and it will actually

1140
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,180
respond with your public IP address so

1141
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:10,920
what Google sees your IP address is now

1142
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:14,089
copy that and go to Mac's mind comm ma X

1143
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,119
M IND comm max mind is a geolocation

1144
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:20,640
technology that allows credit-card

1145
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:24,390
processors and banks and online sales

1146
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,520
portals to use IP geolocation data to

1147
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,920
verify people's identity so that service

1148
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,240
is used for legitimate purposes so that

1149
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,740
people can verify that

1150
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,140
hey yeah you're making a purchase on my

1151
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:37,170
website you're you say you're from

1152
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,250
Quebec and indeed you are check if you

1153
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,410
say you're from Quebec and you're

1154
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:43,470
actually in Israel I think there's a red

1155
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:44,790
flag there so you go to max my comm and

1156
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,660
if you scroll down the page a little bit

1157
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,530
there's a little place where you can

1158
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,930
paste an eye

1159
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,120
P address to test it paste that IP

1160
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,770
address from Google in there and go and

1161
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,310
you're gonna see all the information

1162
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:58,650
that Mac's mind reveals about your IP

1163
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,630
address Oh interesting little test for

1164
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,430
you if you'd like to see what your IP

1165
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:04,290
address reveals I'm doing that today

1166
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,930
very very cool

1167
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:08,070
thank you take it one step further real

1168
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,170
quick it gives you a longitude and

1169
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,730
latitude copy that paste it back into

1170
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,510
Google Maps it tells you where you are

1171
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,270
nope

1172
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:17,010
just try it okay gives you a longitude

1173
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,350
and latitude result paste it into Google

1174
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:23,300
Maps and see what you'll find I'm

1175
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:25,770
actually scared all right

1176
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:28,350
Australia's a multi-million dollar

1177
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:32,010
broadband network is under attack from

1178
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:34,380
cockatoos the national broadcast

1179
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:36,150
networks said it has spent tens of

1180
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,380
thousands of dollars so far fixing

1181
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,960
cables that have been chewed by the

1182
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:42,270
birds they also estimate the bill will

1183
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,880
rise sharply as more damage is uncovered

1184
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:46,650
in an attempts to improve Australia's

1185
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,820
internet speed currently lagging behind

1186
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:53,150
many developed countries 11.1 megabits

1187
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:55,200
per second a national telecommunications

1188
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:57,540
infrastructure project has been

1189
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,920
instigated and is due for completion in

1190
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,010
2021

1191
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,140
but engineers have engineers returning

1192
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,840
to sites have been finding spare cables

1193
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,910
chewed and frayed the culprits are

1194
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,540
cockatoos a type of parrot which

1195
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:16,290
normally eats fruit nuts wood and bark

1196
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:18,510
and now wires the company has had to

1197
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:20,400
replace power and fiber cables at the

1198
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:22,650
cost of tens of thousands of dollars

1199
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,860
each time so far they say they have

1200
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,870
spent $80,000 of local currency which is

1201
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:31,110
roughly sixty one thousand five hundred

1202
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:33,360
u.s. the company says it's currently

1203
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:36,240
installing perfected perspective casings

1204
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,010
which cost $14 each and that will

1205
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,500
protect the wires from the birds in the

1206
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:42,870
future and save billions of dollars and

1207
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:49,290
save their 3 billion dollar Network for

1208
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:53,880
further damage stop making the internet

1209
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:57,000
out of nuts and berries it reminds me of

1210
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,589
an old story that we told in the news

1211
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,499
about mice were eating the in

1212
00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:05,259
like the soundproofing or something

1213
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:08,729
inside a car that was all yes yes right

1214
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:09,910
they had some kind of biodegradable

1215
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:13,229
insulation

1216
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:15,579
yeah and wiring the traction that was

1217
00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:16,869
apparently delicious so I'm thinking

1218
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:18,249
that the birds probably aren't eating

1219
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:21,609
the wires I think that they're probably

1220
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:24,449
using them as as either nest material

1221
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:28,449
because it probably looks like a twig or

1222
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:30,640
perhaps Australia didn't think about it

1223
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:32,410
and put something yummy in there you

1224
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,359
know what I think it's more that they're

1225
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:37,630
sharpening their beaks I mean they're no

1226
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:39,819
yes cockatoos are known to pack a sharp

1227
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:44,410
sharpen their beak so you get something

1228
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:46,869
like a good solid wire and looks like a

1229
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:48,939
good thing to sharpen a beat guy I mean

1230
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:51,489
as weird as this story is that it's

1231
00:49:48,939 --> 00:49:52,420
cockatoos yeah what I was actually most

1232
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,839
shocked about is the fact that their

1233
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:57,759
internet is so slow oh 11.1 megabits per

1234
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,579
second and that's high like their

1235
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:03,279
average in Australia is 8.5 like that's

1236
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:06,189
insane how was it that it really is so

1237
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:08,890
far behind on that oh how far behind are

1238
00:50:06,189 --> 00:50:11,349
they well think about this ultra HD

1239
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:13,420
video on Netflix is 25 megabits per

1240
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:17,289
second alright so why are they so far

1241
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:20,589
behind Jeff talk to know I think you

1242
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:22,539
know it's probably political the the the

1243
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:25,829
company that runs the internet service

1244
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:29,019
in Australia is government-run and in

1245
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:31,299
you know the early 2000s the plan was to

1246
00:50:29,019 --> 00:50:33,819
upgrade the infrastructure to fibre

1247
00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:36,939
we're gonna do 100 megabit fiber lines

1248
00:50:33,819 --> 00:50:38,739
all throughout Australia and upgrade

1249
00:50:36,939 --> 00:50:41,019
every one so you know I think the plan

1250
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:43,119
was that 95% of Australia would have

1251
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:45,579
access to fiber internet that was the

1252
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,650
plan now the 2013 election happened and

1253
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:48,939
the Liberals came in and said you know

1254
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,099
what we're actually gonna change things

1255
00:50:48,939 --> 00:50:53,769
and we're going to instead we're gonna

1256
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:55,569
focus on cost savings we're gonna try to

1257
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:59,199
make you know we're gonna make the black

1258
00:50:55,569 --> 00:51:01,959
here and that didn't go so well for the

1259
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:04,630
internet no no the choice was made at

1260
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:06,759
that time that instead of upgrading to

1261
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:09,519
fiber we're gonna tap into the existing

1262
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:11,859
copper infrastructure and try to work

1263
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,520
with that so use newer technologies over

1264
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:15,010
the

1265
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,630
per infrastructure and keep going with

1266
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:17,800
that now so the the idea was that it was

1267
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,170
supposed to be cheaper it was supposed

1268
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,660
to be faster to deploy and it turned out

1269
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:24,430
it was neither and it's costing them a

1270
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,410
lot of money and they've got this

1271
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,570
terrible infrastructure that is being

1272
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:31,300
eaten by cockatoos that's too bad you're

1273
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:35,380
tapping into nature I think that the

1274
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:36,910
solution would be it's government stuff

1275
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,860
right like so it's like a government

1276
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,420
monopoly over the internet so imagine if

1277
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,250
your internet service was provided by

1278
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,440
the government that's how it is in

1279
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:47,740
Australia so because of that

1280
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:51,100
infrastructure is completely driven by

1281
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:53,980
governmental budgets and and legislation

1282
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,660
and and bureaucracy so you think about

1283
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:58,210
that and you know if they would just

1284
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:00,400
privatize that sector of you know the

1285
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,020
the infrastructure of Internet

1286
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,100
telecommunications if they can privatize

1287
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:07,390
that everywhere cried well I've got a

1288
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,950
different perspective I'm sure but you

1289
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,690
think about that you know why are they

1290
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:12,730
so slow that's the question yeah why is

1291
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:16,360
their internet so slow because it's it's

1292
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:18,700
not per me it's it's not publicly right

1293
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:20,650
you know it's private right now I wanted

1294
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,900
to you know I think that sorry it should

1295
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,250
be public because it was public then

1296
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,720
we've got competition

1297
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,980
we've got fair competition we've got the

1298
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,050
price coming down you know the

1299
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,730
government says oh well the Australians

1300
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:32,950
don't want it to be faster

1301
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,350
we don't want that's what they say

1302
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:38,080
that's what the CEO of the the broad

1303
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:38,470
broadcast company or whatever they call

1304
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,260
themselves

1305
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:42,640
that's what they said but the fact in

1306
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:44,050
Kilis they don't want to pay for it

1307
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,960
you're watching and you're from

1308
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:49,300
Australia yeah please call me am i right

1309
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,730
like it's not I mean the government is

1310
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,650
misquoting Australians and saying that

1311
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:55,140
they don't want to have it when really

1312
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,010
they just don't want to pay the

1313
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,690
astronomical fee that the government

1314
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,790
wants to charge them for it so if it was

1315
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:03,040
public instead of privatized pardon me

1316
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:05,230
if it was public then there'd be

1317
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,450
competition and the infrastructure could

1318
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:09,550
go up and the cost could come down so

1319
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:13,119
now I can get faster internet and it's

1320
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:16,119
affordable that's the key thing so

1321
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:21,290
really the tagline out of this is Polly

1322
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:26,750
want a cookie cookies

1323
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:26,750
[Laughter]

1324
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,570
