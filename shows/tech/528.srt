this past week was was Halloween yes and

81
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,190
I was talking to back at the night

82
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,780
before so Monday night I said you know

83
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,489
are we all said everything is good

84
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,890
because I knew I was gonna be getting up

85
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,900
that morning Halloween morning going to

86
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,430
work and then meeting the family

87
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,810
elsewhere we're not gonna have time to

88
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,850
do anything because that leads right

89
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,650
from work to trick-or-treating right

90
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,170
said you know is there anything that we

91
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,230
well I couldn't find any candles for the

92
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,940
pumpkins

93
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,190
I you know this is the night before

94
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,849
Halloween folks I went to two different

95
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,220
stores

96
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:43,680
everybody's cleared right out of tea

97
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,620
light candles of course

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,159
never fear baby your maker husband to

99
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,730
the rescue but all I had was a couple of

100
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:57,430
LED bulbs that are basically well you

101
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,819
know fifty bulbs per lightbulb Oh Oh

102
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,260
which is fine it's all I had so you know

103
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,690
being the maker that I try to be I

104
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,549
decided to get out some old cat5 cable

105
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,790
and I cut off the rj45 from the end

106
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:12,280
basically turn an ethernet cable a

107
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,260
internet cable into a power cable no way

108
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,109
cut the end off of a 12-volt power

109
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,380
supply plugged it all in got everything

110
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:23,530
working in a parallel circuit and fired

111
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,169
up those pumpkins and it was like

112
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,260
staring into the heart of a supernova no

113
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:31,600
way super oh yeah stop laughing when I

114
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,270
saw this the picture and the fact that

115
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,650
my phone actually lens flared when I

116
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,610
tried to get a picture of it that's

117
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,220
hilarious

118
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:43,539
it worked anyways but that's the the

119
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:46,030
would be maker trying to help out right

120
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:47,800
did work had you known that that was

121
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,750
yeah how'd you know that was the case

122
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,979
really you could do those pumpkin

123
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,660
carvings wear you don't carve all the

124
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,479
way through you just like scrape a

125
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:58,780
little bit and so next year like don't

126
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,940
destroy this idea in any way next you're

127
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,030
just like carve with a spoon or however

128
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,099
you do it to like to make it thinner you

129
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,260
say that because actually like a thick

130
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:10,870
pumpkin yeah my daughter's pumpkin there

131
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,560
on the left was translucent that's how

132
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,940
bright this light was oh so but it's LED

133
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,650
doesn't generate any heat so I thought

134
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,440
well you could probably you know put it

135
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,270
in you know put it in a mason jar and

136
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,060
paint the outside of the mason jar or

137
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,310
something - you know dim the light you

138
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,490
could do all kinds of things how much I

139
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,780
saved the day anyway I saved Halloween

140
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,150
hopefully you had a fun and safe

141
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,940
Halloween I want to say thanks to orange

142
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:40,479
man who was thoughtful and sent us a

143
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,550
handful of SAS drives SAS drives I don't

144
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,969
have a SAS controller but I want to keep

145
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,409
an eye out for for an economical

146
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,310
solution so that we can plug these

147
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,840
things in

148
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,550
boot them up and and then do a

149
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,750
demonstration on Derek's Putin nuke

150
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,520
which I think would be really cool

151
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,650
because when you pull drives out of a

152
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,450
system you want to wipe them completely

153
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,610
so that any confidential data that's on

154
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,250
those drives is gone right there's your

155
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:07,090
search term as Derek's boot and nuke or

156
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,650
also called D ban DB a.m. okay what it

157
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,800
does is you boot up from a USB flash

158
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:15,370
drive or us a CD if you burn it to a CD

159
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,810
and it will basically wipe every sector

160
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,460
of any hard drive that's connected to

161
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,740
the computer oh that's cool

162
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,020
don't run it on your normal computer no

163
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,490
but you can use this for things like

164
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,990
this where orange man sent us some

165
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,850
drives and we don't know what

166
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,280
confidential data is on there so we want

167
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,890
to wipe them out in order to protect the

168
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,980
confidentiality of that information so

169
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,780
that might make a really cool little

170
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,790
demonstration be a helpful demonstration

171
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,860
so that everybody who say wants to give

172
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,780
their computer or use computer donate

173
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,220
right so just know how to wipe your own

174
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,020
dress well the fact is is when you

175
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,160
delete files off your hard drive can you

176
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,140
believe that they're actually still

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,690
there we've talked about data recovery

178
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,520
services in the past where you format a

179
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,350
drive and accident you know and

180
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,060
accidentally delete all your files and

181
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,520
then take them to a data recovery lab or

182
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,870
use something like photorec and be able

183
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,670
to get those files back because they're

184
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,980
not actually deleted mm-hm

185
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,540
so yeah if you give away your computer

186
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,610
or sell it or something you want to make

187
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,330
sure that everything is absolutely gone

188
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,160
but really you know I'm a real firm

189
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,020
believer in recycling and you know

190
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,240
reusing things that can still be used

191
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,280
until they're no good anymore right so

192
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,790
the whole idea of smashing the hard

193
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,490
drive to protect your data that's fine

194
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,220
it protects your data but that drive may

195
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,310
have another five years life in it it

196
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,810
really is wasteful right would help us

197
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,430
with that so I guess that kind of leads

198
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,520
me to say hey if anyone has a SAS

199
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,200
controller PCIe send it over to the

200
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,410
studio and that will give us a chance to

201
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,830
try out these drives Orangemen sent us

202
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:50,680
315 K drives and two 10k drives okay so

203
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,990
what be pretty cool quickly what a SAS

204
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,600
driver is the SAS Drive is a hard drive

205
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,390
but okay it's not SATA it's not MDOT -

206
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,710
it's a different interface ok SATA

207
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,380
versus yes

208
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,970
your computer builds yes so this is it

209
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,500
just a different one okay

210
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,260
you're a different protocol as a matter

211
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,720
of fact to be completely accurate but I

212
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,810
don't have any computers that use it so

213
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,970
right you need that card again in order

214
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,440
to give us the ability to use those

215
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,110
drives plus cables I guess I would need

216
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,750
as well so oh that'll be a fun show that

217
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,760
would be that will definitely be and

218
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,340
speaking of now we I mentioned your

219
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,830
gaming rig series now we did a 10 part

220
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:33,820
series where sasha Rickman built a

221
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,800
computer from nothing to a fully running

222
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,380
gaming computer it's right at your house

223
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:43,060
right hooked up to what you've got a 60

224
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:46,930
some-odd inch yes 4k TV it runs awesome

225
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:49,390
great yes it's perfect I will say I need

226
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,280
to find a different Mouse your mouse has

227
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,870
a little bit of interference right now

228
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,180
wireless mouse so the keyboard works

229
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,310
well yes which they came as a kit as a

230
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,560
set they were pretty cheap like they

231
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,390
weren't they I mean they got overly

232
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,560
expensive so so what we're gonna do is

233
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,910
we're gonna try out a couple of the

234
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,890
different mice that we have at the

235
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,170
studio and that I use myself personally

236
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,490
and plug them into that computer see

237
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,220
which one gives you the best response

238
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,230
and Sasha was asking why would that be

239
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,510
why would it work in some cases and not

240
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,210
at home and you know you think about a

241
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,220
mouse it's a wireless piece of

242
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,510
technology you might have a portable

243
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,190
phone in your house that's using a

244
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,680
similar frequency and interfere they

245
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,230
have elect other electronic components

246
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,820
that are interfering with that wireless

247
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,370
connection it could be your your

248
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,040
wireless router could be right same

249
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,110
frequency 2.4 gigahertz and frequencies

250
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,850
you know channel 10 somewhere its

251
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,640
channel 7 you know whatever it happens

252
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,050
to be so that may be the cause right you

253
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,700
try a different mouse that's a different

254
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,100
frequency that's you know when we were

255
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,290
kids we with our remote controls you

256
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,510
remember the remote control cars I had

257
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,150
to have a 49 megahertz one and my

258
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,070
brother had to have a 37 megahertz 100

259
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,710
they might be controlling it in both

260
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,150
cars would be going right to different

261
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,220
frequencies interfering with one another

262
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,360
very simple example that really brings

263
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,280
it home and makes it understandable

264
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,810
anyways you know something else that was

265
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:13,620
very interesting about my Dave's

266
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,000
super awesome new computer well when we

267
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,720
were setting it up and looking at it on

268
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,520
the screen

269
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,260
we noticed that all of the fonts and

270
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,779
everything because it's 4k and we sit

271
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,960
far away was so super small right so

272
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:28,380
luckily we have a great friend named

273
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,300
Ravi who said what exactly did you do it

274
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,190
was like a little like the little icons

275
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,230
that it can click I created to bash

276
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,900
scripts one called 1080p and one called

277
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,570
4k and within those bash scripts these

278
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,510
are Linux batch files if you will

279
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,910
very very simple programming I used an X

280
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,650
R & R command in order to change the

281
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,650
frequency and the resolution of the

282
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:52,890
display so basically what I did is the X

283
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,740
R and R and then told it to scale HDMI 0

284
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:59,160
which was the first HDMI output which is

285
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,940
plugged into your TV right to 1920 by

286
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,410
1080 at 60 Hertz ok and so when you

287
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,000
double-click on that and run it it

288
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,620
changes it to that frequency because

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,540
that's the only command in the file

290
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,779
then you click on the 4k one and it

291
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,630
switches it to 4k which is 3840 by

292
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:18,900
perfect so we are using that like so

293
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:21,990
often you would not oh yeah imagine web

294
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,450
on a 62 inch or 60 whatever inch TV huge

295
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,330
TV right and when your font is this big

296
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,040
because of such high resolution at 4k

297
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,839
exactly so yeah we're searching

298
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,700
everything we're searching you know 4k

299
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,650
videos so that we can wow our friends

300
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,500
and then we switch pop it back in and

301
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:40,170
play this one surround sound come on

302
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:47,160
over HDMI which linux detected just fine

303
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:48,810
and yes we definitely have to get a new

304
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,490
mouse when we get have to get some games

305
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,130
loaded on there it turns out dave steam

306
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,170
account was under an old email address

307
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,780
and he couldn't find his password so

308
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,910
there's a lot of the and they're helping

309
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,440
him they're going through yes but he

310
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,930
made over his account so he gets the old

311
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,260
games back exactly but it's a little bit

312
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,290
of a time-consuming venture but what can

313
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,600
you do worth every second and speaking

314
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,150
of time-consuming if you want to spend

315
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,730
five hours watching that series I know

316
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,470
the entire rig from the beginning to the

317
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,060
end you can watch all five hours if

318
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,889

today because I because I'm a patron

326
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:41,119
contributor oh yeah so I can grab my

327
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:43,699
popcorn and watch myself build a

328
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:45,499
computer perfect we've got to take a

329
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:47,119
really quick break now when we come back

330
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:50,119
we're going to be taking a look at how

331
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:52,339
we can use the air turn stomp 6 in order

332
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:56,059
to control our computer

333
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:59,629

for watching welcome back this is

346
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:33,769
category 5 technology TV and tonight we

347
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,019
are taking a look at a really cool

348
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:39,259
device from air turn it's called the

349
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,429
stomp 6 cool just the box I've actually

350
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:44,329
got the pedal as well

351
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:48,709
so essentially you may want something

352
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:51,259
like this as a controller for your

353
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:53,419
guitar effects or something like that

354
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:58,220
right kind of recognize that do you guys

355
00:13:53,419 --> 00:14:00,290
see that that's kind of the heart this

356
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,739
device you can stomp sticks from air

357
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:08,660
turn and what it is is in fact a

358
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:10,160
bluetooth keyboard with 6 keys oh ok so

359
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,129
we're gonna talk a little bit about what

360
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,439
that means for us but essentially I mean

361
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:17,299
if you're a musician this is fantastic

362
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,609
you've got an iPad or an Android tablet

363
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:21,139
you put your sheet music up on the

364
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:24,559
screen and then you can flip the pages

365
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:26,179
with your foot right so you've you're

366
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,489
jammin and you've got the sheet music on

367
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:31,220
the screen for a beautiful also you can

368
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:32,989
pick up like a quarter inch input for

369
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,930
your phone plug your guitar into your

370
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:36,060
phone

371
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,220
and then out into an app or pair of

372
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,230
headphones and then use a stomp six as

373
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,480
the controller because it's bluetooth

374
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,540
right where your phone so now it becomes

375
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,750
a guitar effects pedal on the cheap like

376
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,930
they're not expensive Hey that is cool

377
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,940
but because it's a bluetooth keyboard

378
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:58,110
what else can we do we can connect it to

379
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,870
a computer and then there is no limit to

380
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,970
what we can do we can program if we want

381
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,040
to do some makin we connect this to a

382
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,450
Raspberry Pi and make it do all sorts of

383
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,420
cool stuff right

384
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:12,870
basically it is a fully wireless

385
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,580
Bluetooth controller that we can tell

386
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,560
the software what we want it to do

387
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,770
because it's just six different keys on

388
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,940
a keyboard okay first of all the first

389
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,640
thing that we need to do is we just need

390
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,900
to fire it up just holding the power

391
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,780
button you're gonna see a little light

392
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,910
flash and then over here on my windows

393
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,290
system now I've got Windows 10 in our

394
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,700
broadcast computer so this is going to

395
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,100
be really interesting tonight Sasha

396
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,080
because we're actually going to bring up

397
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,000
our screen which is going to cause a

398
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,860
rift in the space-time continuum because

399
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,190
we're broadcasting live I'm gonna bring

400
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,840
up our screen on your screen so that you

401
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:49,320
can see the configuration steps that I

402
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:52,350
take so there's us Oh thumbnails there

403
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm way below okay so one second delay

404
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,270
on thumbnails so let's get a look at

405
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,930
what Windows says to us so I've got this

406
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,970
thing powered on let's go Bluetooth and

407
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:05,570
other settings there we go so you see

408
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,040
the air turn there is connected

409
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,630
brilliant so it's really easy I mean

410
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,880
it's just a Bluetooth device but it

411
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:15,660
connects just like that so now if I

412
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,880
bring up something like notepad and all

413
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,320
I'm gonna do let's see if can you see me

414
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,390
and the thumbnail there I'm just gonna

415
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,570
hold up the keyboard and just push the

416
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:28,290
first key basically the first pedal and

417
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:31,590
what that's done is its output the

418
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,570
number three so this first pedal is

419
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:36,600
basically just the number three on a

420
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,550
keyboard right now Telestream Wirecast

421
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,110
is the software that you saw there on

422
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,570
your screen and that's what it looks

423
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,430
like to us here in the studio other than

424
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,080
we've got some crazy stuff happening in

425
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,170
the preview window because we're kind of

426
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,710
a bit of a loop but that is broadcast

427
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:55,260
software it's perfect for web casters

428
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,510
like ourselves television shows sports

429
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,670
casting it's got everything for sports

430
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,500
casters including the ability to put

431
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,840
scores up on the screen in real time

432
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,459
it's got I mean it's perfect for

433
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,040
churches that want to broadcast their

434
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,560
services every Sunday great businesses

435
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,690
or town halls city halls that want to

436
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,430
broadcast meetings it's a great piece of

437
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,470
software to turn a computer into a

438
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,959
broadcast suite but it's sometimes tough

439
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,280
Sasha to have somebody always operating

440
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,600
that did you see all the buttons and

441
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,280
stuff that I have now I've watched

442
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,170
screen controller here as well

443
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,080
so when I touch things that's it's

444
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,510
moving around that way but you don't

445
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,570
always have someone to do that so having

446
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,570
a foot switch like the stomp 6 from air

447
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,550
turn is gonna make things a lot simpler

448
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,070
but the question becomes how do I now

449
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,960
turn this Bluetooth Keyboard if you will

450
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,180
this Bluetooth foot switch which is

451
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,060
powered by a single 9-volt battery right

452
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,580
how do I make it work with Telestream

453
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:54,660
Wirecast that's what I going to show you

454
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:59,190
tonight folks let's see so let's head

455
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:02,640
back over to notepad and you'll see that

456
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,380
3 is the first button when I press the

457
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,120
button so that means that I'm actually

458
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,220
in mode 2 and I know this from the

459
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,020
manual so if I press the second button

460
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,940
it's a semicolon if I press the third

461
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,310
button it's a P the fourth button is a

462
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:18,500
capital R and then a space and then the

463
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:21,240
last one is actually control Z so this

464
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,160
tells me that mode 2 now I've chosen

465
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,740
mode 2 as the best option for this

466
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,060
particular use case you can change the

467
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,790
mode there are four different modes and

468
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,530
it changes what the keys output okay you

469
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,050
can set it mode one where this is page

470
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,490
up page down and so on so there are

471
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,020
different things that you can do with it

472
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,730
with the four different modes

473
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,650
I think mode 2 works really well for

474
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,440
Telestream Wirecast because of the fact

475
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,870
that we have all standard keys from a

476
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,750
keyboard but then number 6 which we use

477
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:51,870
as our programming key is a control key

478
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,520
so unfortunately that key is not

479
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,850
compatible with Telestream Wirecast

480
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,820
that's because it's the undo key so now

481
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,220
what we end up with is 1 2 3 4 5

482
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,090
controlling Telestream Wirecast and then

483
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,369
control Z which is undo so it's a quick

484
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,200
foot flip to undo whatever it is that

485
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:11,789
you have done right typing and you need

486
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,190
to undo it real quick there you go

487
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:15,919
so jumping back here let's get a look so

488
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,779
we've got this thing connected in mode 2

489
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,190
and really really simple to change folks

490
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,830
you've got the manual if you pick one of

491
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,049
these up you get one a cap 5 dot TV /

492
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,609
air turn but all you do is you just hold

493
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,289
in button number 6 with your foot or

494
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:30,720
your finger and then it starts flashing

495
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:33,690
in the flashes you count them one two

496
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,840
three four boom you're in mode 4 if you

497
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,580
let going right 1 2 let go now you're in

498
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,590
mode 2 could not get easier oh it's so

499
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,659
simple alright and the manual shows you

500
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,210
what the key sequences are for each of

501
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:46,649
those and we know it from bringing up

502
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,450
notepad as well so let's get a look at

503
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:50,429
Telestream Wirecast so first of all I

504
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,739
need to tell Telestream Wirecast

505
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:54,989
hey how do I communicate with this

506
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:56,639
particular device it's really simple

507
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:59,729
because as I mentioned Telestream

508
00:19:56,639 --> 00:20:02,549
Wirecast works with keyboard hotkeys so

509
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:07,830
in this case I can click on add and I

510
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:10,080
can call this stomp 6 button 1 and then

511
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,940
over here in the right hand side now all

512
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,700
I do can you see me on the thumbnail I'm

513
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,789
just going to push button 1 done and it

514
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,440
entered a 3 ok now I'm going to set that

515
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,869
to global so that it doesn't have to

516
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,460
have Telestream Wirecast as the

517
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:24,479
foreground application in order to

518
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,950
switch ok

519
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:28,049
that's handy you may want to turn that

520
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,429
off if you are commonly switching over

521
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,749
to Facebook and things like that well

522
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,509
broadcasting because as soon as you hit

523
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:35,190
3 boom your shot changes now I'm going

524
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:36,019
to add another button and I'm gonna call

525
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:41,820
this one

526
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:44,580
stomp 6 button 2 and then I push button

527
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:48,470
2 on my stomp 6 and it put a semicolon

528
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:53,009
make it global then I add the next one

529
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:56,129
stomp 6 button 3 you're getting the idea

530
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:59,549
right oh yeah three there we go it's a

531
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:01,799
capital P now all I do is I exit out of

532
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,599
that and I now I've only done the first

533
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,210
three buttons because we are just doing

534
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,279
a demonstration you get the idea you can

535
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,769
have multiple devices set to different

536
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:13,299
modes and then you can have one two

537
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,950
three four five as some

538
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:16,720
witches then you can have another stop

539
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,730
six set it to a different mode I have

540
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,679
one two three four five six or whatever

541
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,119
you want to do and program them

542
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,980
independently of one another so that

543
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,289
you've got multiple devices controlling

544
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,600
different camera shots okay

545
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:30,519
so over here at Telestream Wirecast now

546
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,009
that it knows how to communicate with

547
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:35,830
this device I'm gonna simply right-click

548
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:39,489
on my shot and go keyboard shortcut and

549
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:42,970
assign it to any one of the keys that I

550
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:45,789
set so but number three hey is now going

551
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,529
to be this shot our main shot now if I

552
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:49,929
look at you there on the green screen

553
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:53,049
and I right click and go let's make you

554
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:55,659
button number two now watch what happens

555
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,549
so button number three we're already on

556
00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:00,789
that shot now if I push button number

557
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:04,559
two guess what happens push number three

558
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:07,539
again see super button to button three

559
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,700
I'm just putting it off my finger but

560
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:11,200
here's the idea here is with a stop six

561
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,570
you put that on the floor it's out of

562
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,730
the vision of your viewers and it's

563
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,320
something really really easy in order to

564
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,899
switch between shots I like to use like

565
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,200
a P touch labeling system to also put

566
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:25,149
you know Sasha shot main shot in shot

567
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,779
that kind of stuff put it right on there

568
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:30,879
and of course it's reusable for from

569
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:32,470
task to task right now that I've set it

570
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:34,720
up with Telestream Wirecast it's not

571
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,929
just a Telestream Wirecast controller I

572
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,419
can now take it to my jam and start

573
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:43,389
using my phone as a guitar effects pedal

574
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:45,639
as well very slowly makes it seem like

575
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:48,220
there's a whole crew it really does

576
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:49,600
right super super easy to set up and

577
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,600
there you have it that's how you do it

578
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,820
on Telestream Wirecast and that again is

579
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,720
a suite of software that turns a

580
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:00,609
computer into a broadcast system and it

581
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,460
is available at cat5 dot TV slash

582
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:04,720
Wirecast check them out it's a great

583
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,970
suite of software it's what we use here

584
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,669
at category-five TV but I love

585
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,039
absolutely love adding the air turn

586
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:14,320
devices to the mix because it gives me a

587
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:16,809
way to switch shots really easily really

588
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,679
seamlessly and usually you probably

589
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,869
don't even know that it's happening

590
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,920
because I can just flip a switch with my

591
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:24,290
foot right

592
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:29,150
cool as that check them out a game cat

would go oh were you going to say

619
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:44,270
something no I'm excited about this next

620
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:49,540
product that we're showing too because

621
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:52,790
it's almost Christmas because Dave now

up

625
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,450
this is this is actually really cool now

626
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:05,020
you remember Joe bees do bees make

627
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:08,390
fantastic products they make the the

628
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:11,330
bluetooth headphones that actually work

629
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,410
as hearing aids as well right so you

630
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,720
know they make some really innovative

631
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,940
stuff but what they've done here is an

632
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,860
affordable desk lamp and I know we're

633
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:24,590
thinking Oh desk lamp right I understand

634
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,880
that but this one is really really cool

635
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:29,440
I want to tell you a couple of key

636
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:33,080
points about the jeebies lifestyle lamp

637
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,190
first of all I mentioned just before the

638
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,930
break that this might be good and

639
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,610
kind of like a home studio environment

640
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,500
if you're right shooting some pictures

641
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:43,470
or some video this would be good you

642
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,420
want to know why why I do want to know

643
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,250
why when we're working in a studio we've

644
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:50,400
got these great big soft boxes all

645
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:54,090
around us they are key to our production

646
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,470
because they are daylight balanced they

647
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,370
have a special kind of light bulb that

648
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,260
is like the Sun okay super super super

649
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,450
bright but it's the frequency the color

650
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,730
that they generate so it gives a much

651
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:08,160
better cleaner picture right now this

652
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,560
light has multiple different frequencies

653
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,180
that you can tune into so by simply

654
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,670
pushing a button and I'm not sure how

655
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,380
well you're going to see the change on

656
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,380
your screen but I can actually select

657
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,380
between twenty eight hundred thirty four

658
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,530
hundred forty five hundred and even 5600

659
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:28,140
Kelvin I can change the color frequency

660
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,310
so that makes it multipurpose if you're

661
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,170
reading at night you want something

662
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,640
really low frequency so that it's kind

663
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:35,910
of like an orange e hue right like a

664
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,610
warmer light right and then during the

665
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,140
day or when you if you want to use it as

666
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,520
something like a broadcast lamp which i

667
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,220
think is a really great idea especially

668
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,380
considering the form factor you can set

669
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:51,330
it to like 5600 Kelvin which is daylight

670
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,880
beautiful light you can also adjust the

671
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,470
brightness so I can actually turn it up

672
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,410
and again I don't know how well this

673
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,600
translates on a camera but it does make

674
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,520
a difference to us I also like here at

675
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,840
the studio I can set a timer of one hour

676
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,610
or two hours and it'll automatically

677
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,380
shut off so if you want to turn it on

678
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,390
and then have it turn off for you

679
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,280
automatically right it's just a single

680
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,560
touch and these are all touch sensitive

681
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,330
buttons not even buttons you just touch

682
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:19,050
them like you know those touch lamp yeah

683
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,310
it's just like that very neat now what

684
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,050
does this have to do with tech Robby

685
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,760
okay great I'll give it that you can

686
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,350
change the frequencies of light without

687
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,460
having to change the lightbulbs usually

688
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,670
you have to do that to get different

689
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:32,670
frequencies right what makes it so cool

690
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:35,220
from a tech perspective any idea well I

691
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:38,260
feel like I have an idea I've ever heard

692
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,320
of Qi yes I have

693
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,809
so sash has got a particular little

694
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,350
phone here that that she brought in and

695
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:50,110
sat down next to this lamp and suddenly

696
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:52,750
it started charging the phone because it

697
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:55,960
has Qi compatible charging there goes

698
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,730
it's charging it's at 81% and your

699
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,620
screen has just come alive so let's get

700
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,000
a look at actually in the box and I know

701
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,340
that there are some instructions here

702
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,200
that tell us a little bit more about it

703
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,880
so nice you know nice design right folds

704
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,650
down and is you know I don't even need

705
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,450
to really get into the box because of

706
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:15,460
the fact that I've got one already set

707
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,049
up here but we can articulate it we can

708
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,880
do all kinds of things it does not

709
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:21,910
swivel left and right but it goes up and

710
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,500
down and can be kind of tilted in such a

711
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,710
way that you can get it out of your eyes

712
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,690
or tilt it up and kind of illuminate the

713
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,640
room a little bit so but the Qi

714
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,870
technology is really from a technology

715
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,840
standpoint this is something that we

716
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,610
want to start seeing in our devices so

717
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,110
as far as that goes what it means is if

718
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:40,419
you've got a phone that has Qi

719
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,940
compatibility if you've got a SmartWatch

720
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:46,570
if you've got any device that has the Qi

721
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,040
logo on it it will charge it by just

722
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,020
simply putting it on top of this lamp

723
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:54,910
which is perfect so we're talking

724

iPhone 6 even down to the floor you can

734
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:31,960
buy special cases that have Qi and will

735
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:35,230
automatically charge as well same thing

736
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,730
with the pen pen tax and BlackBerry's if

737
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,320
you have a Z 30 or something like that

738
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,110
so this will charge your phone just by

739
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,169
simply setting it down no cables but oh

740
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:47,409
my lg g3 doesn't have support for it so

741
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:48,999
what do I do it also has a USB port in

742
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:50,889
order to plug in my phone for

743
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:52,809
standard charging well that's not so bad

744
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,909

00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,849
category 5 TV newsroom Microsoft has

758
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:33,489
ended production of Kinect its motion

759
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:36,129
tracking games controller it may sound

760
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:38,469
like an April Fool's prank but no Amazon

761
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:40,659
really does want you to want to give you

762
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:43,359
that their delivery drivers a key to

763
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:45,729
your house a Google company chose

764
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,059
Toronto Ontario as the building site for

765
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:51,129
its new futuristic city a Microsoft rep

766
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:53,979
had to switch to Chrome during a

767
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:56,529
presentation because edge kept crashing

768
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:58,959
and remember the robot that said it

769
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:01,299
would destroy humans well it just became

770
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:03,639
the first robot to gain in the world to

771
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:06,239
gain citizenship these stories are

772
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:09,369
coming right up don't go anywhere

773
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:13,450
Jeff Weston Jemma you're building a

774
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:17,250
brand-new beautiful website what

775
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:20,110
are you come on you're terrible actor

776
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,610
what this we're acting comes into play I

777
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:24,610
don't know where I think you're supposed

778
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:26,169

00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,950
cool website just because Jeff is

781
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,370

the week's top tech stories with a

793
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:05,529
slight linux bias I'm Sacha Rickman in

794
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:06,129
here the top stories were following this

795
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:08,559
week

796
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:10,509
Microsoft has ended production of Kinect

797
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,580
its motion tracking games controller

798
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:14,499
Microsoft has confirmed that the gadget

799
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:17,619
originally sold as an add-on for the

800
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:20,139
Xbox 360 console and later bundled with

801
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:22,450
Xbox one will no longer be manufactured

802
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:24,309
this will bring an end to a player

803
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,220
sensing platform that was sometimes

804
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:29,200
finicky Microsoft was careful to note

805
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,600
however that support for the device as

806
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,809
well as development of new software for

807
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,539
the hardware by third parties will not

808
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:39,489
see in abrupt end the news hardly comes

809
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,529
as as as a surprise though given

810
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:43,799
Microsoft's push in recent years for

811
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:46,539
augmented and virtual reality

812
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,700
Microsoft is aggressively pushing games

813
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:50,919
developers towards its more powerful and

814
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,129
immersive not to mention lucrative

815
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:56,799
Windows mixed reality VR headsets for

816
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:59,139
their new titles while the few business

817
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,739
use cases there were for the Kinect are

818
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:04,539
being moved over to the hololens

819
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:07,179
Microsoft has already distanced the

820
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:09,190
Kinect from the Xbox with new consoles

821
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:15,669
no longer being bundled with the sensor

822
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:20,159
bar so what business use cases was there

823
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:24,609
for Kinect yeah picture it like gaming

824
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,919
like dance dance dance revelution right

825
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:28,690
stuff I think really what it boils down

826
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:31,389
to is like you think about an immersive

827
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,940
environment where an engineer for

828
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:36,639
example can work with blueprints and it

829
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,470
like think a Minority Report oh where

830
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,779
you can you know use hand gestures to

831
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,690
move things around and be able to move

832
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:46,619
them around but being off of the screen

833
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:50,619
and into hololens now you can actually

834
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:52,899
maneuver holographic looking also is

835
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:56,049
that what hololens is hololens just is

836
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:57,700
holographic like actual essentially like

837
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:59,609
from the wearer's perspective hololens

838
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,139
is a VR headset Oh

839
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:04,779
Microsoft's brand but what's different

840
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:06,759
about it unlike oculus rift or HTC's

841
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:08,889
units and things like that

842
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:11,049
it is not

843
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:12,609
virtual reality in that it's not like

844
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,129
you can't see anything else

845
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:17,819
typical virtual reality oculus and so on

846
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:20,079
our screen in front of your eyes right

847
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:22,059
hololens what's different about it is

848
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,919
that they are clear lenses in front of

849
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:27,359
your eyes so you're seeing the region

850
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:29,349
and then it's augmenting that world with

851
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,440
virtual holograms

852
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:34,389
so you see around you all these other

853
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,889
things right they're not actually there

854
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:37,779
so it's a different environment

855
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,369
altogether right you can see that

856
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:42,429
hololens could work really really well

857
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:44,470
in an engineering kind of scenario think

858
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:46,809
about architecture things like that I

859
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:49,179
would be fantastic and there's no limit

860
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:50,529
to what could be you know the creativity

861
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:54,369
of the programmers and what they could

862
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:58,180
do with hololens right starting naming I

863
00:34:54,369 --> 00:35:00,579
have I have a big problem though with

864
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:04,650
the fact that if everything is VR

865
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:08,200
headsets or even holo lenses right then

866
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:10,289
with gaming how do you share your gaming

867
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,980
experience with other people in the room

868
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:16,240
obviously everyone brings their own raft

869
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,819
that would be awesome

870
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,859
no typically what would be done and

871
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:24,160
you've you've built your gaming computer

872
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:26,710
you've got four 4k video outputs on that

873
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,920
card plus a DVI output and you can do

874
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:33,309
mirroring so for example if you plugged

875
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,400
in an oculus rift and did video gaming

876
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:39,069
right sample and the wearer is

877
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,710
interacting in a virtual space but the

878
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:43,990
people in the room could be watching it

879
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,450
simultaneously on the 60-inch TV okay

880
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:50,589
that's important for me because I'm a

881
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:54,670
I'm a game connoisseur in the watching

882
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:56,829
fashion but I love watching the kids and

883
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:59,529
I love the excitement behind it exactly

884
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:01,809
but yeah it would be a little bit bland

885
00:35:59,529 --> 00:36:03,910
if I was just was just watching somebody

886
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:06,089
with a VR headset on just moving around

887
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:10,720
and what do you see what do you see

888
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:11,349
what you just do yeah okay so it all is

889
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,940
not lost

890
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:17,019
no it should be actually either way this

891
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,360
is crazy

892
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:20,580
yeah

893
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,310
it may sound like an April Fool's prank

894
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,950
actually but Amazon really does want to

895
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:29,550
give their delivery drivers a key to

896
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:31,920
your house the new Amazon key system

897
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:34,410
allows delivery personnel to drop off

898
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,620
packages inside Prime members homes

899
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:39,320
providing secure home access when the

900
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,660
homeowner is not available

901
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,820
Amazon key works in two parts choosing

902
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,670
in-home delivery while checking out on

903
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,220
Amazon and providing access to your home

904
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,320
through Amazon's new key and home kit

905
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,210
which includes a smart lock and a

906
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,820
special version of the company's new

907
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,770
cloud camp security camera the

908
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,810
old-school method of leaving a key

909
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:04,020
underneath your doormat is inconvenient

910
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:06,270
and often anxiety inducing as well so

911
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,160
Amazon believes its new lock in camera

912
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:10,580
system will make accessing your home

913
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,170
when you're not around more secure

914
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,420
Amazon delivery employees aren't given a

915
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,100
passcode to enter the home rather they

916
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,050
request access into the home and

917
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,060
Amazon's records verify that the

918
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,130
employee is at the right address at the

919
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,110
right time

920
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:27,870
Amazon key will launch on November 8th

921
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:30,390
and 37 cities around the u.s. and works

922
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:33,780
with same day one day to day and

923
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:37,250
standard shipping orders you know what

924
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:41,250
which one of you watching at home or

925
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:42,780
yourself has ever put a key under a rock

926
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,880
under the you know in the front garden

927
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,280
and told Amazon to put your things in

928
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,710
the house never ever never ever ever

929
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,480
have you know yeah

930
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,760
goodness me I don't want Amazon walking

931
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,260
into my house no I will tell my

932
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,260
neighbors sometimes if there's something

933
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:01,080
big that's coming says I'm not here

934
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:05,460
leave it with Joe next door exactly but

935
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:08,340
Amazon in my house like how how is it

936
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:11,940
that the employee requests access to the

937
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:15,000
house even well it's a smart lock they

938
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,820
would have some way of you know they're

939
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,070
tracked by GPS by Amazon and Amazon you

940
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,830
know call center is in control of your

941
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:25,470
lock so when the delivery person arrives

942
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:27,990
then all of a sudden your cloud cam

943
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,270
turns on and so you can see on your app

944
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,850
that hey the delivery person is there

945
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,890
you can actually see them entering

946
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,500
house and Amazon will actually unlock

947
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:39,590
the door for remotely remotely right

948
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,480
yeah in a very secure situation they

949
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,910
don't literally have a key or a key code

950
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,890
right they walk up to the door GPS says

951
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:48,320
to Amazon headquarters hey they're here

952
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,660
with the delivery and they punch in

953
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,720
whatever in their their mobile device

954
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:57,140
and then Amazon opens the door there is

955
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,880
no way that that's not hackable it

956
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,250
really does seem like an app like a

957
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:07,250
April Fool's joke like it was not

958
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:08,780
November I remember in the old days it

959
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,280
beside your house you would thank me a

960
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,810
box there was one of my in that my

961
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,030
childhood home there was I think it was

962
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,100
like a milk delivery box to be honest

963
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,600
they opened just one little part and

964
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,070
they and there's like a compartment in

965
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,500
the side of your house and I'm through

966
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:24,410
they can't well and it's just big enough

967
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,850
for parcels yeah exactly I don't know I

968
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:28,040
can see you know we've talked about

969
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,270
people stealing Amazon packages from

970
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,310
people's front porches and stuff but

971
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:33,140
really you know that that really has to

972
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:36,380
be our responsibility to just like any

973
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,540
delivery system for for me I opened a

974
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,830
postal box when I get all my parcels

975
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,690
delivered to the postal box and then I

976
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:44,990
don't have to be there right and it

977
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:47,990
saves me a lot of trouble so homeowners

978
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,730
then if you have a theft in the house

979
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,130
any time after you've had a package

980
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,170
delivered what is your insurance gonna

981
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,550
cover because you've let somebody you

982
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:58,460
don't know into the house and perhaps

983
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:02,090
that person themselves would have some

984
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:03,740
sort of claim saying well yes I was just

985
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:05,000
delivering a package but that doesn't

986
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,390
save them from telling somebody else

987
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,130
let's go I mean assume assuming you're

988
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,290
cloud cam is active in working uh-huh

989
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,610
you can see what's going on you can see

990
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:16,760
who it is that's entering the house so

991
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:17,870
at least you give it that right but you

992
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,610
know I think about stuff like what if a

993
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,280
dog gets it what if you know this or

994
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:24,470
that or I don't know I just I'm not for

995
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,960
it I am NOT for what do you think

996
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:30,110
comment below please do I have an idea

997
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,930
Amazon actually why don't why doesn't

998
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,670
Amazon just sell like boxes that you can

999
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:37,550
screw to the side of your house or affix

1000
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,280
somehow there are a lock box will step

1001
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,110
back to the 60s right not not a problem

1002
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,840
at all

1003
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:48,400
Amazon box that they have a key to oh my

1004
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:50,050
gosh see there you go goes on this box

1005
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,850
outside of your house exactly

1006
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,380
garbage bin and they just put your stuff

1007
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,460
in there and then they lock it when they

1008
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:59,260
leave that's what I'm saying

1009
00:40:54,460 --> 00:41:03,210
bring it on in random delivery people

1010
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:06,460
access to my home Google know Amazon bin

1011
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:08,710
we're gonna call it patent that register

1012
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:12,040
the dot-com do it now okay

1013
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:14,080
in awesome technology news Google's

1014
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,480
Irvine innovation offshoot looked at

1015
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,880
hundreds of international cities before

1016
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,800
choosing Toronto's East Waterfront as

1017
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,830
the best site for using technology to

1018
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,960
radically remake the modern city Dan

1019
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,270
Doctoroff chief executive of new

1020
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,160
york-based sidewalk labs said his two

1021
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:33,040
year old company looked across North

1022
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,440
America Western Europe and Australia for

1023
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,880
the best place to try new ideas

1024
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,250
including self-driving buses and mass

1025
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,650
production modular homes intended to

1026
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,690
solve major problems of urban live

1027
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:47,230
living such as high housing costs

1028
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:49,570
commute times social inequality climate

1029
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:52,630
change and even cold weather keeping

1030
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:55,110
people indoors sidewalk labs settled on

1031
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,910
Toronto for several reasons including

1032
00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:01,330
unequal diversity and spirit of openness

1033
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,950
a booming tech sector and three levels

1034
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:04,660
of government that are committed to a

1035
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:07,690
waterfront Toronto's unfolding

1036
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:11,140
redevelopment plans for 800 acres of

1037
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:13,510
East downtown land Doctoroff said his

1038
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:16,120
company will spend 50 million dollars on

1039
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,220
a year long discussion starting at a

1040
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:20,710
public meeting held today with citizens

1041
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:23,290
governments universities and others

1042
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:26,680
about what project what the project

1043
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:28,300
dubbed sidewalk Toronto should be Google

1044
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,570
Canada will move it to Richmond Street

1045
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,220
headquarters to the area sidewalk labs

1046
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:35,200
says it would have an insatiable

1047
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,660
appetite for partnership with other

1048
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,790
companies including local tech startups

1049
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:42,760
as well as universities and others on

1050
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:45,370
the build build-out officials stressed

1051
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,470
that all plans are tentative until the

1052
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:49,450
end of the consultations nevertheless

1053
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:51,820
the sidewalk labs winning the

1054
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,590
submissions paints a futuristic picture

1055
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,240
trays

1056
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:57,090
rotation would be provided by small

1057
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,610
self-driving taxi BOTS controlled by app

1058
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:02,670
services with self with self-driving

1059
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:04,860
buses to follow an already planned

1060
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:06,840
waterfront light rail line would link

1061
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,880
new communities with surrounding areas

1062
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,550
the flow of people would be monitored

1063
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,490
and maximized by computer sensors

1064
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:16,800
constantly analyzing data instead of

1065
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:18,930
city garbage trucks rumbling through

1066
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,430
streets robot vehicles would move waste

1067
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,310
and other goods through underground

1068
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:25,170
tunnels weather mitigation features

1069
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,300
including windshields and possibly

1070
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,280
heated surfaces could double the time

1071
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,220
people spend outside and encourage

1072
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,250
cycling and walking there are big

1073
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,230
questions and challenges some worry that

1074
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,690
Google which makes money with data about

1075
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,600
people's lives could use the new project

1076
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:44,310
in a way that jeopardizes privacy

1077
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,470
sidewalk labs documents that were

1078
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:49,530
released last month don't dispute that

1079
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:51,960
such data will be collected but do try

1080
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,730
to lessen such concerns with assurances

1081
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,020
that security and privacy protection

1082
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:59,670
will be part of the new infrastructure

1083
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,920
lots of concerns there like lots of

1084
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,380
really cool stuff happening right I

1085
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,160
think like the future city is the future

1086
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:11,520
but what about putting Google in

1087
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,710
government basically like where who

1088
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,460
elected Google to be the government of

1089
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,300
this future city do you know yeah I do

1090
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,040
know what you mean

1091
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,830
yeah it's the money that good that

1092
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,500
elected Google yeah it's yeah me money

1093
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:28,560
did that yeah but do you understand that

1094
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:33,360
like yeah they're gonna have to be

1095
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:36,150
granted basically blanket ability to run

1096
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,430
this community right to be the

1097
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,730
government of this community essentially

1098
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:45,030
true and if that happens well who you

1099
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:47,790
know what what what does democracy have

1100
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:50,400
to say about that and our voting you

1101
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,870
know who are we voting for say you know

1102
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,090
not to get political but there are

1103
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:56,330
concerns I think that are quite valid

1104
00:44:54,090 --> 00:45:00,090
there I'm a technological standpoint

1105
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:02,400
right so cool very cool one one question

1106
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,740
I really have about that story was

1107
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,680
social inequality being

1108
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:11,080
change by technology which doesn't

1109
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,020
exactly like it sounds like a little bit

1110
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,430
of like pretty talk to me like why would

1111
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,160
they say that why would they just add

1112
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:20,020
that in one pound or how can that how

1113
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,610
would that work I can see some other

1114
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,650
things right like yeah you mentioned

1115
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:26,260
that in immediately you know I know

1116
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:28,390
social inequality but the word socialism

1117
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,640
comes to mind and I start to you know

1118
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:32,530
wonder is it is it a utopian society is

1119
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,850
that what they're trying to build are

1120
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,340
they trying to build something where

1121
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:38,080
nobody is for want and everybody is

1122
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:41,200
taken care of or you know what's the

1123
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,600
deal right they talk about and the you

1124
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,820
know the papers have talked about like

1125
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:50,290
the release papers that Sidewalk labs

1126
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:53,230
have released discuss low-income housing

1127
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:56,080
and the ability for anyone can afford to

1128
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,990
live here and and it's designed so that

1129
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:02,040
everybody has access the transportation

1130
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:04,390
system is accessible and able to

1131
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,130
accommodate everyone from all different

1132
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:07,900
walks of life so how are you going to

1133
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,570
get a spot there because there's not

1134
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:14,260
gonna be a limit right so that's just a

1135
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:17,650
starting point the the idea is to expand

1136
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:20,350
this right some like the future one

1137
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,420
thing I love about this and I saw a

1138
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:25,150
video a long time ago about solar

1139
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,890
roadways and I feel like perhaps this is

1140
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,570
the time right where that could actually

1141
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:30,430
happen yeah great

1142
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:32,380
and that's a cool idea to where the you

1143
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:34,480
know the solar panels in the roadway are

1144
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,450
able to absorb the sunlight during the

1145
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,570
day and then feed it back into the

1146
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:42,340
infrastructure at other times or even

1147
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,980
feed it back into electric cars and

1148
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:48,270
vehicles and things like that right

1149
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,680
there is the thought to that if they're

1150
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:53,320
doing away with garbage trucks they're

1151
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:56,350
doing away with garbage truck drivers if

1152
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:59,080
they're doing away with again socialism

1153
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:01,240
comes to mind right I thought that hey

1154
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,690
you know robots can do the job for us we

1155
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:06,880
can just enjoy life and live for

1156
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:10,150
different purposes in a way right you

1157
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,490
know live to live right living to work

1158
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,840
right I do love the idea of garbage

1159
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:15,760
being taken away by garbage BOTS

1160
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,890
underground tunnels which also means

1161
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,490
that you could probably get your Amazon

1162
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:23,460
or

1163
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:29,200
through undergrad which is amazing

1164
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:33,099
Amazon underground register.com for

1165
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:35,230
ideas today okay a Microsoft rep has

1166
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:37,390
been caught on video switching from edge

1167
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,549
to chrome in the middle of a sales pitch

1168
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:42,460
because the native Microsoft browser

1169
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:44,680
kept crashing on him the presentation

1170
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,660
was designed to show customers how easy

1171
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,569
it is to migrate apps and data to

1172
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:51,190
Microsoft Azure except it would seem

1173
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:56,250
that that's not the case if you're using

1174
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:59,319
Microsoft's own web browser edge nice

1175
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:01,720
edge hangs that unknown Microsoft

1176
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:04,030
demonstrator says I always love it when

1177
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:07,299
demos break so while we're talking here

1178
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:09,250
I'm just gonna install Chrome he

1179
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:12,130
chuckles as the audience breaks into a

1180
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:14,440
nervous ripple of applause it's all very

1181
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:16,750
charming and friendly and everyone is on

1182
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,390
the same side but it still makes for

1183
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,339
slightly cringe-worthy watching he goes

1184
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,170
on to complete the demo in the

1185
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:24,510
competitors browser to a course of

1186
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,789
giggles from the audience

1187
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:29,980
Microsoft edge is currently way behind

1188
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:32,829
its rivals in terms of market share in

1189
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:35,109
particular Google Chrome it has a far

1190
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:37,000
less developed ecosystem and the number

1191
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:38,980
of bells and whistles and add-ons is far

1192
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,920
less than the competition with some also

1193
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,660
claiming the performance is bad however

1194
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,400
for a company that is still trying to

1195
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,069
convince the business market that it is

1196
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,470
is really a really good idea switch from

1197
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:53,170
windows 7 to Windows 10 Microsoft

1198
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:55,240
employees giving up on the company's

1199
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:57,520
default browser because it crashes well

1200
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:01,450
running the default cloud interface is

1201
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:05,680
not going to instill much confidence Wow

1202
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:11,920
true so true that is crazy and funny and

1203
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:14,500
crazy kudos to him I mean good job on

1204
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,270
just you know what we're all people like

1205
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,250
I mean you've got a you've got to go

1206
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:20,799
with what works but you know it doesn't

1207
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:22,510
that say a lot about edge I know and the

1208
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:25,390
four people that you know get Windows 10

1209
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:28,029
and don't know to install Chrome stuck

1210
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:30,010
with edge ouch right why would

1211
00:49:28,029 --> 00:49:30,580
businesses be reluctant to switch from

1212
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,920
seventh

1213
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,870
ten windows seven well you remember when

1214
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,310
Windows XP ended and you know there are

1215
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:39,160
still people running it for the next

1216
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,930
five years it just is it's hard to it's

1217
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:45,070
hard to switch paradigms for one thing

1218
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:48,010
but it's costly you think about an

1219
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:50,590
industrial business that has CNC

1220
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:52,360
machines and big equipment that is

1221
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,040
powered by Windows seven and then tell

1222
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,510
them oh by the way I know you just

1223
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,940
bought this five years ago but you need

1224
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:00,190
to upgrade just because we've changed

1225
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,530
software but the computer still work the

1226
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:04,210
CNC machines still work no I'm not doing

1227
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:07,080
it so you get this real hesitation that

1228
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,970
you we're not going to invest another

1229
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:12,460
you know a hundred thousand dollars in

1230
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,710
equipment and upgrades and then IT

1231
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:18,280
support just because Microsoft says so

1232
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:22,660
so that you get this kind of a kid

1233
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:26,680
mentality like no I'm not but also I

1234
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:28,270
think that you know why why do they not

1235
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,760
want to switch to Windows 10 I think

1236
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:32,950
they see stuff like this right because

1237
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,540
it keeps happening my laptop

1238
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:36,220
you notice my laptop is not on the desk

1239
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:38,380
because I haven't had time to fix it

1240
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:40,630
after the anniversary update right

1241
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:43,990
because it completely it won't even boot

1242
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:45,490
anymore so in a business when I hear

1243
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:48,430
these kinds of things and I have a

1244
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:50,080
hundred employees under me and I say are

1245
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,550
we all gonna roll up to Windows 10 and

1246
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,860
hope for the best or are we gonna keep

1247
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:55,750
using what we know where we know what

1248
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,090
we've invested some of software dollars

1249
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:59,920
on it kind of begs the question like

1250
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:02,950
don't they have enough money to make it

1251
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,380
good like what why is it so yeah why is

1252
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:08,680
it so underdeveloped wise edge versus

1253
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:11,170
chrome like why isn't it working it

1254
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:14,530
doesn't make sense to me with a company

1255
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:18,640
that has that it seems like limitless

1256
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:20,530
resources why is there there default web

1257
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,570
browser behind zone I mean you ever

1258
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:24,940
think about Chrome and the the release

1259
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:27,520
system and the development platform that

1260
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:29,500
Google has for that browser and you know

1261
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,630
you've got pretty much weekly updates

1262
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:34,270
happening to Chrome now look it now

1263
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:36,580
enter that market now try to bring out a

1264
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:39,190
new browser in that market and try to be

1265
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:41,020
competitive with browser that has been

1266
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,119
in development for many many years and

1267
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:46,809
is getting weekly up

1268
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:49,150
and getting features added weekly and

1269
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:51,609
then try to enter that and compete

1270
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:53,739
against that good luck you're going down

1271
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:56,410
right if they weren't Microsoft they'd

1272
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:59,019
be they'd already work on yeah

1273
00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:02,380
so then why bother because they want

1274
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:05,890
control they want that monopoly without

1275
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:07,869
saying monopoly that's true we want

1276
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:12,249
everyone to be running our software

1277
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:17,069
mm-hmm that's it crashes and then yeah

1278
00:52:12,249 --> 00:52:17,069
to install Chrome fantastic Oh

1279
00:52:17,859 --> 00:52:24,249
in March last year an empty eyed

1280
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:25,900
humanoid robot named Sophia was asked

1281
00:52:24,249 --> 00:52:28,269
during a live demonstration at the South

1282
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:31,509
by Southwest festival do you want to

1283
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:35,079
destroy humans please say no and with a

1284
00:52:31,509 --> 00:52:38,440
blank expression Sophia responded okay I

1285
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:40,749
will destroy humans and now a year and a

1286
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,519
half later Sophia has become the first

1287
00:52:40,749 --> 00:52:45,460
robot in the world to be granted

1288
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:48,609
citizenship saudi-arabia bestowed

1289
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:51,130
bestowed citizenship upon Sophia ahead

1290
00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:53,880
of the future investment initiative held

1291
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:58,599
in the kingdoms capital city of Verdun

1292
00:52:53,880 --> 00:53:00,670
on Wednesday Sophia told the audience I

1293
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:03,190
am very honored and proud of this unique

1294
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,660
distinction this is historical to be the

1295
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:07,450
first robot in the world to be

1296
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:08,920
recognized with a citizenship it didn't

1297
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:11,019
elaborate on the details of its

1298
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,479
citizenship at the event

1299
00:53:11,019 --> 00:53:15,160
Sophia also addressed the room from

1300
00:53:13,479 --> 00:53:17,549
behind a podium and responded to

1301
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,650
questions from moderator and journalist

1302
00:53:17,549 --> 00:53:23,349
Andrew Ross Sorkin questions pertained

1303
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:25,989
mostly to Sofia status as a humanoid and

1304
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:29,319
concerns people may have for the future

1305
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:32,259
of humanity in a robot run world Sophia

1306
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:34,059
told Sorkin you've been reading too much

1307
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:36,579
Elon Musk and watching too many

1308
00:53:34,059 --> 00:53:39,640
Hollywood movies don't worry if you're

1309
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:43,390
nice to me I'll be nice to you treat me

1310
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:45,670
as a smart input/output system she did

1311
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:48,430
not say what would happen if he was not

1312
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:51,339
nice to her fortunately for the human

1313
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:52,960
race the Sophia robot made comments that

1314
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:55,359
it wanted to use its artificial

1315
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,049
intelligence to help humans live a

1316
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,209
better life

1317
00:53:56,049 --> 00:54:00,299
and that it will do its best to make the

1318
00:53:58,209 --> 00:54:05,799
world a better place

1319
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:08,469
Wow okay got in there there is Wow okay

1320
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:11,949
first they made a humanoid robot and

1321
00:54:08,469 --> 00:54:15,999
they named it Sophia but that doesn't

1322
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:18,189
make it she right or he a female it does

1323
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:20,199
not like now right exactly like I'm

1324
00:54:18,189 --> 00:54:22,420
having a little bit of problems with it

1325
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:24,609
it's still an answer remorse yeah it's

1326
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:28,749
like an anthropomorphic fallacy thing

1327
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:33,989
it's an it Sophia cool name for an it

1328
00:54:28,749 --> 00:54:38,170
but it's not but then it's a citizen now

1329
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:41,349
right so that crosses some weird divide

1330
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:44,920
too and and why is this just for

1331
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:47,109
publicity is it what yeah I don't know

1332
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:50,979
the motivation behind today it's weird

1333
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:53,160
because then like it's progress and I

1334
00:54:50,979 --> 00:54:58,679
know that robots are you know a key

1335
00:54:53,160 --> 00:55:01,179
focus point but it's our official

1336
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:03,099
intelligence right so that means that

1337
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:06,939
somebody somebody's obviously

1338
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:12,519
programming Sophia Hanson robotics right

1339
00:55:06,939 --> 00:55:15,339
so and so then if people like now if

1340
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:18,969
Sophia is seen as as this individual

1341
00:55:15,339 --> 00:55:22,809
free-thinking citizen robot the citizen

1342
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:25,689
mean is it individuality or just does it

1343
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:30,670
even mean in this case can a bridge be

1344
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:32,559
married right you know like but I think

1345
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:36,579
as a free-thinking artificial

1346
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:39,849
intelligence it is a hard line to to

1347
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:41,469
really draw right because when when she

1348
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:43,929
responds even though it seems like you

1349
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:45,910
know semi canned answers sometimes are

1350
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:48,400
they canned answers or is this AI

1351
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:50,319
actually thinking and responding in the

1352
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,269
way that it feels that it would and I

1353
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,069
think it is because you know that's what

1354
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:57,489
happened a year and a half ago when it

1355
00:55:54,069 --> 00:56:02,070
responded okay I'll destroy humans yeah

1356
00:55:57,489 --> 00:56:04,740
by becoming a citizen well

1357
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:06,680
it's it seems weird and then what sort

1358
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:09,570
of regulations are going to be put on

1359
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:11,130
like do you pay taxes I know in some

1360
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:15,420
cases Oh gates thinks that they should

1361
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:18,030
right do they vote and who program that

1362
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:21,990
vote in citizens can vote right in so do

1363
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:23,910
political views of a robot right I mean

1364
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:27,210
and in some countries there's a huge

1365
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:32,880
divide as far as like gender roles so in

1366
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:36,930
that case - there's a huge now being you

1367
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,450
know where where she is I guess it's a

1368
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:41,820
fine fine detail but there's a there's a

1369
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:45,210
real uproar right now because she it is

1370
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:48,390
considered a she right in a place of the

1371
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,980
world where you know the uproar involves

1372
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:54,270
things like her face is not covered

1373
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:57,390
right stuff like this exactly this robot

1374
00:56:54,270 --> 00:57:00,000
have more rights as a female than a

1375
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:02,070
female right and that's a whole other

1376
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,330
can of worms that is erupting right now

1377
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:09,120
over this whole thing it's just it's

1378
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:11,760
slightly unsettling to me not slightly

1379
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:14,700
it's unsettling it for somebody who

1380
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:17,540
loves if Jeff was here he's he agreeing

1381
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:21,330
with you I know somebody who loves

1382
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:23,580
robots I love robots as robots here I

1383
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:28,230
don't love robots yeah I don't love

1384
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:30,630
robots being citizens having rights at

1385
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:33,300
like this robot would have the right to

1386
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:38,220
vote I would assume being that it's a

1387
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:40,860
citizen yeah well that's a real big

1388
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:41,970
question yeah what are your thoughts I

1389
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,340
