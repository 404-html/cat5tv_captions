we just finished episode number 413 I'm
just sitting in the studio parking lot
and I can't even pull out because my the
storm is so bad can't even see out the
windows so I'm just going to kind of
wait for a minute oh my goodness those
who were in the chat were just after the
show well you know at the end of the
show I said it's looking like a bit of a
storm out there and then it got really
bad we've got one window that is letting
some water in so I put a bowl there and
I'll have to come back when when things
settle down and get that taken care of
figure out what's going on there
probably just a little bit of caulking
or something but yeah this is what it
looks like here after episode number 413
you can't even probably tell
it's nasty
fine and hopefully soon I'll be able to
pull out everybody else made it out just
as it was starting everybody got soaked
but I'm absolutely drenched try to get
the equipment out and and in the van
safely added a couple rent anyways
thanks for tuning in and thanks for
watching category 5 TV I'm going to get
it going once the windows clear up
starting there we go almost see-through
anyways take care I'll see you soon bye
I was just about to pull out and this is
not good we have a ditch on either side
of our driveway and it is so full of
water I can't tell where the ditches and
where the driveway is it just looks like
soul and all the way across I'm going to
have to step out see
ah
oh it's like a foot deep
standing in a foot of water and that's
happening
holy crap
please
oh man
I mean
I am glad that I'm able to stay on high
ground there are some people who would
have been going home
areas a lot of hills
and if you have to go down one of these
hills to get up to where you live I
don't even want to think about how much
water there is down
an email everybody make sure they got
home safe
