category five technology TV the game
show now on July 17th my birthday
yes 2012 you and I were sitting on the
set we did an amazing show in Studio C
it was a fun show but here we are more
than five years later and unfortunately
the files are corrupted so all we have
now is the video and the audio is
completely kaput so fortunately the
video is there and fortunately we have a
resident professional lip reader you do
sign language that's all I can do and
you've been doing this all your life so
what better person to help me to recover
this show so what we're going to do
tonight is we're going to use your
capabilities to flawlessly read the lips
from episode number what did I say it

this back together and bring this
episode back from 2012
