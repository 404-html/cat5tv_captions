let's get straight to it so over here at
the Raspberry Pi 3 we're gonna bring up
the terminal and over here at the Odroid
xu4 queue I'm gonna do exactly the same
thing now you'll notice this is a full
operating system this is not like a
stripped-down this is the new boom boom
it a as you would expect so over here
I'm gonna go H top and we see four cores
with it looks like 750 megabytes of RAM
and over here on the Odroid xu4 we've
got eight cores and 1.9 five gigs of ram
and both are pretty much doing nothing
right now they're sitting idle
