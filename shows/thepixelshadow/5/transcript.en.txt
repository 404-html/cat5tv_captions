hi this is the fifth episode of the
pixel shadow where today we've been
having a little bit of leg of the
facecam so it will be off most of the
video but at least you'll still get to
see me play today we're going to be
doing a challenge in the bill battle
Stadium you have a theme and everyone
ends everyone gets a room well the
players we have two players right now
tots 1524 and D Kelly 810 so I'm going
to pick a theme and everyone has to
build something from the creative
inventory reveled in revelle relevant to
it um and after 5 minutes we only get
five minutes we're going to try and time
that and um we're going to as over here
in the chest we have terrible bad okay
good epic and legendary you place it
what's this guy doing here well anyway
you have to place it inside like that
like that to show your vote so that you
know like so that you can prove how good
you think it is and at the end of the
game once everyone's finished folding we
check to see who got the most votes and
whoever got the most votes wins and we
will destroy our builds and pick another
theme will try and do about two to three
games today so that'll be good and so
we're going to start this start the game
there's no fun allowed if you connect we
can play the game and what are you doing
out of your prison cell get back in
there and um we're going to start the
game so in the chat i'm going to say
scene is hmm
I think that we should do forest forest
animals go so we're going to go to the
creative inventory and build a type of
forest animal so I'm going to go get
some wool I think I'll do a fox some
white and orange wool get a little bit
of red wool and some blues wait let's
get some of that hmm search up some
black black wool and a s4 ashphalt we'll
get some of that because it's a good
black bloc and let's begin so the first
I'm going to do the hind legs
or the front legs I mean
it's going to be a pretty simple Fox not
gonna lie
since there's no flying loud it makes
building a lot more difficult so that's
a pretty good tale
we're gonna build the face
gotta make them have a back
just smash fault here
this guy's gonna be pretty cute but
Derby oh my goodness it's the dirtiest
thing in the world I'm gonna have to
wait I'm gonna make the head thicker so
that it'll won't be so derpy
five minutes is the time limit so after
five minutes everyone has to start
folding
it's pretty cute
so now we gotta make a bit more on here
and we'll do the ears
just going to make this one block
outwards so that we don't see
see the eyes from the other side cuz
that'd be pretty great
just look big
and I think we're pretty much done maybe
we should add some trees or something
you're going to quickly clear my
inventory and I'm going to
tree
just going to make a regular
to leaves
I grabbed the wrong type of leech
Plus that was a bad
I'm just going to make like a pine tree
sort of
I couldn't plant a tree with a sapling
because that just wouldn't work because
it takes oh there's no bone meal in
rented so that would take too long to
and I think I'm done yes oh no no no
quick quick no there's only ten seconds
left okay keep calm dad biggest shocks
in the world taller than the pine trees
whoops it's the biggest Fox in the world
you can fly with floating because then
it'd be too hot so i'll quickly five and
floating begins whoo this is q is is
this a moose that's cute I'm going to do
epic
