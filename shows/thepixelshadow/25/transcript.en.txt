is fast here
oh that looks what's the exclamation
point mean it means it's new its new
yeah well in that case let's go for that
ooh yeah that looks fast all right
definitely matches Morton style yes Oh
Morton you animal oh where to go there
you are okay
look at me I'm loving so Watson they go
just to just just for the sheer irony of
it 150cc are you nuts yeah all right
I'm player two am I gonna be on the
right side of the screen you're on the
left yeah
we're sitting in the wrong order as
we're recording this do we need to move
sure okay okay you move that way and if
you guys could see this you'd be like
whoa they're actually moving and that's
not very exciting all right here we go
could have planned that a little better
hey to be fair this is our first episode
it might keep stabbing me
this doesn't might keep stabbing it oh
sorry
I forgot that was this stabby Mike whoa
all right you ready for this yes all
right so what when I go on the right all
right are there any kind of buttons that
I need to know about here oh oh I hit
definitely not that one all right
Oh oops yeah okay
wait what have you done okay I was
seeing what my settings are oh you took
my thing all right what's the button to
fire
[Music]
while the rumblepack on this controller
is awesome I'm gonna put a link to this
controller in the bottom in the
description there Oh Thank You Daisy
yeah check out the description this is a
like a I went for a cheap controller and
the rumble pack is awesome
I'm bad at this
alright did I get anyone Oh lasers
okay I've got a ball of fire in my hand
nice he's got terrible aim this Morgan
that's you know that's totally Morgan
okay how come these guys keep passing me
I'm not fast like their cuz you're bad
yeah
well that was to look behind me okay X
button looks behind oh where am I
goodness me
that Daisy gets me every time look out
for the banana
oh-oh-oh I am a loser
you're not I'm in ninth place how many
places are there nine know there's
probably seven places and somehow I
landed in nine yeah ba ba
your sweat staring on no wait don't how
you do are you kidding me well that's
why I'm doing so poorly yeah how do I
turn off smart steering press left left
oh my goodness are you serious you're
gonna fall off the ground how would you
tell how would I have known that because
then 10 on the back the intent oh oh are
you kidding me the antenna on the back
of my wheels yeah okay now I know oh you
know what did I get ya look I'm in
second now that I turned off smart
steering came in first I came in second
so you were in last like the entire game
yeah and then I turned off smart
steering and became the boss so you
still beat me by like a nanosecond hmm
had I turned off smart steering yeah one
nanosecond earlier I would have whipped
you yeah you watch this is a figure
eight so this is gonna be nice and easy
nice and you this is just allegedly
stroll
oh there's cars there's vehicles give me
that oh and I missed it come on now get
out of the way every time that you hit a
car no it's the car hit me come on now
get it right back oh yeah here we go
car get me all you want Oh
how do I go faster like this is a slow
you get 150 C's you have to get better
power-ups okay well like that 100k or
the magic mushroom that helps drifting
makes you go faster oh but it also makes
you hit it also makes you hit stuff well
you have to not hit stuff that would
probably help in my goal not to hit
stuff what is the advice that I get from
her
don't hit stuff it's good at right I
wish all kinds of buttons who doesn't
seem to do much I can look behind me Hey
oh no come on
give me all those does it matter if I
get three question marks does that work
to my benefit I got three question marks
does that do anything for me you know
the the mystery blocks technical terms
all right this is the one I want
oh no what
just I was blind there for a moment
hey now
so this is miles above previous gens of
Mario Kart for sure hey Tara for the
record you're in fifth I'm in six sided
terrible air because I got hit brothers
say of course it is of course it isn't I
probably threw it no you did it I
probably did I serious I'm a
professional
so load time is really fast the mic
keeps going into my face does it is it
stabbing you I set it to stab mode okay
let's do this
you should probably turn on smart
steering do you think I should turn on
smart steering because if your says I'm
so smart okay that was fun
so I'm in fourth you're in second oh no
I just jumped into six is that about cuz
you're banned
no I'm awesome come on
whoa whoa come on yeah that's why you
need to have smarts too well how do you
how I guess I could have drifted a
little bit yeah I could have taken that
ramp oh come on
so for the record I hate this level
everyone hates Rainbow Road do they so
it's not just me so I'm like right in
tune with the gaming community yeah
excellent
oh no you're an 11 and there's probably
nine spaces probably oh come on he keeps
doing that jumping down in front of me
Oh get away banana oh I'm about to lap
you it's I thought I had enough speed to
take the jump you need a mushroom I had
a mushroom
I don't think oh I mean I think I had a
mushroom I mean this is my first time
really seriously my first time seriously
playing this game as you can tell I am
dead serious right now yep
oh yeah goodbye
ah I did so bad all right I got a star
which has got to be a good thing oh come

star not a mushroom maybe that's what I
did last time but you started

not a professional Mario Kart gamer I'm
bad at this game

days so we'll give you that oh oh look
out for that turtle well I've played
this game before see there's a Gerber
Daisy

that's what
that's just cuz you're bad so you're
just like old you won't steal you get
the rumbles and joy Kahn's not really
you can really feel the rumbles in this
controller that I'm using yeah I'm quite
impressed with oh for sure
are we feeling the rumbles after you

drifting with Martin is more like
sliding into the side of the track
that's just cause you don't okay what
the heck are with these ice cream cones

going the right way otherwise you're Wow

animal crossing come on they're six more
rounds of this folks this one you have
to kill people with with on bombs okay
this is actual bombs not even bullet
bill I can mix up my Nintendo characters
because I'm just a novice all right I
got a BA Bom
I'm gonna blow y'all up it's like a
context yeah it's Luigi's Mansion
Minnifield is so hard you just have an
unending supply of bombs very the limit
is 10 oh it takes too long to throw them
so it doesn't you just have to plan it
right I'm so bad at this I started too
get Oh wave your arms come on I got
three balloons left I'm going down
oh come on give me a break I was safe I
did it again
unpause there we go Wow I saw it when it
was kill oh sure I did
yes that was totally my fault ah yo she

oh they gave me three more balloons just
for good measure yeah but you lost three
of your points oh I lost all my points
all attributes
I must have must have had three points
oh I doubt it okay now I have none and
now I've got I'm so gonna get killed
thanks a lot toadette

we both got one point so we're tied for
11th and there was nothing below us this
looks cool this one you have to collect
as many coins as you can I just race on
this track this looks amazing if you
want but no I want to win and I will win
this is my first place right here all
right so you said I'm looking for coins
right there's a coin here's another coin
up here oh and I missed that because I
was too focused on nailing him with that
there oh I don't I should have taken
that coin from you oh you didn't but why
didn't I that's the question is
hey I'm the king
this all there is to it is just getting
coins yeah in slow motion
feels like slow motion
oh come on how could I possibly have
missed that I know your point exactly
right yeah I got feather oh yeah good to
get to you okay
it was a feather dude ha I lost my
feather oh no I got it oh it makes me
spin it makes you go up in the air

was I didn't see that
I will win this game I got it ha ha 10
coins

where to go you have to okay I see that
little it looks like a Sun thing with a
crown and I'm following I'm like Mario
Sunshine no I just drifted around that
thing like a box for sure come on there
it is so what are you supposed to do
with it just ride around and not get hit
oh okay but you're not oh oh if you get
that thing no how do you get that thing
by collecting oh you're not being very
helpful here right over there

here and catch you on the flipside
I'm so bad I was so close I don't even
know what I'm doing anymore

don't know what you're doing anymore it
implies that at one point you knew what
you were doing

a link thing I'm pretty sure that you
only have one balloon I've got two and
I've got two points
oh that's lost when you die well now I
have two more believes in you yeah but
that's because you're on your second

law put it what are they teaching our
children here Nintendo evade capture and
what am I supposed to do in this just
evade the law is that it - coins matter
