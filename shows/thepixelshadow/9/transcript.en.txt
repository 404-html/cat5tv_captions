welcome to the pixel shadow I'm angle
Fox 70 today I'm taking rabiosa parkour
challenge along with you guys um people
were everywhere will be racing one
another while balancing over smoking hot
lava squeezing through tight spaces
free-falling thousands of feet and
trying to make it to the end stick
around we've got a great show coming up
following last week's show Nathan s and
Gayle GSAT Sally gave me some tips on
how to find a cave room first of all we
were digging in an already explored area
so the cave realms weren't going to be
there we had to go to a previously
unexplored area and dig there another
tip Nathan Swiss shared was to use no
cliff to fly through the ground in
search of a realm this work brilliantly
and we found not one but two cave rooms
one of which you will see on today's
parkour challenge the parkour challenge
last week was a hit with in only 20
minutes of the show going up on YouTube
we already had new players joining our
server to play the parkour challenge so
this week we thought we'd take it up a
notch welcome to our second parkour
challenge well hello hello to my
challengers there are too many people I
can't I can't name them this time there
are five levels each with their own eat
it with their own challenges there is no
good Ching in these levels and the only
rule is that players are not allowed to
fly use the set home privilege and slash
home commands to create and return to
pub checkpoints and have fun so we're
going to start really closely so we've
got a bunch of people here I'm super
excited
I'm pretty sure we're starting now army
so we're going to go down here and this
teleporter takes us to all the levels so
begin Robbie a parkour challenge so this
is the first level if we die then we
have to restart every single level so
that would really be tragic no
I was the first person to die what I
died three times
how is that even possible look at all
those people
so we're gonna have to restart
dirty
people are dying left right and center
we saw very young and
we died I
so once I get there I'm going to set it
so the way I'm going to send a check for
it is / set
and if I die then I can just do / home
and this is
teleporter which gen 3 to the next level
which is really cool
they still die please don't die again so
so this is
three so I settled
ok bro so if you guys are wondering this
turkey farm looks like since getting
really
I can't see my screen right now
oh my goodness is that what I think it
is
this is getting challenging you can
barely even see your scheme soap
