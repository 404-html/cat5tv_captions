&lt;b&gt;keckeckec:&lt;/b&gt; We're having fun already
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; New face, but old person?
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; welcome Bailey J Thomspon, or BaileyJ as she's known here :)
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; New face, but old person/me chuckles
&lt;b&gt;FBTV-Gunnar-Swed:&lt;/b&gt; It works :)
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Nicely done, anonymous _Jot
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; yeah, nobody will know it was me, it's totally anonymous!
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; wow, that's a voice...
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Hmmm, we have a Taelon on the cast?
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I just had to protect my speakers with all that static previously :)
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I take it audio has been rough the last few episodes?  I am still catching up
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; Bailey should do voiceovers for demon possession movies with that voice...
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; lol kyoshininja
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; no, audio was great, but they had Hillary over as well, and she was forced to use the wireless microphone, which then did the thing it used to do a lot, completely static drowning out everything
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Is BaileyJ the author on a show in the past or am I mixing things up?
&lt;b&gt;IMTech5:&lt;/b&gt; Hi All...
&lt;b&gt;FBTV-Gunnar-Swed:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF has to trim the mic :)
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Hmm, Robbie could teach my local tv stations somethings about audio clarity
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; that's correct GoodGuy! She was at 269 ( &lt;a href="http://www.category5.tv/episodes/269.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.category5.tv/episodes/269.php&lt;/a&gt; )
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; Oh, that's nice...sweet voice now...
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; nice friendly look to match
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; I finally got sound
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Here's a link to the shops so you don't even have to type: &lt;a href="http://shop.category5.tv" target="_blank"&gt;http://shop.category5.tv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cat5.tv/roku" target="_blank"&gt;http://cat5.tv/roku&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Yeah... I update my Roku every day looking for it
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; As long as you have a ~5mbit or faster connection
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We cut the cable a month ago
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; Hello GoodGuy
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy, congrats!  I sure don't miss it
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Roku has a lot of streaming info
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; BOOM!  I'm here!
&lt;b&gt;napa_polarbear:&lt;/b&gt; hi robbi
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I thougt that was her!
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; welcome talky_toaster
&lt;b&gt;IMTech5:&lt;/b&gt; Hey talky_toaster
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Robbie needs his Gollum juice
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Baileys Biography is at: &lt;a href="http://www.category5.tv/bios/bailey-j-thompson.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.category5.tv/bios/bailey-j-thompson.php&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; didn;t she drive to the show?
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Wow, and I thought I was eccentric for my fixation on fountain pens...
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; Heyooo people!
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; My first girlfriend bought her first car in purple
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; BaileyJ, so do you need a pen that uses purple ink? or a pen that is purple? Or specifically a purple pen that writes with purple ink?
&lt;b&gt;BaileyJ:&lt;/b&gt; ppurple ink
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; ROBBIE--&gt; product placement, move your PC pop outta frame!
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; haha nice
&lt;b&gt;napa_polarbear:&lt;/b&gt; my bd on the 3
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; agamotto: fountain pens rule..
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Hillary, you recognized it, I couldn't even tell wht it was :)
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; Hello Hillaryyyyy
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Does BaileyJ run Linux?
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; I loose pens all the time ... I got sick of not caring ... so I bough a $20 pen.
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; so you stick with cheap pens, talky_toaster :)
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; It's Canadian Jot...President's Choice...which makes no sense bc we have a Prime Minister..
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; now you will care when you lose it :-)
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I find that writing with Biro/paste pens is too much like writing in mud.
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; LOL!
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, try scissors
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; wall warts
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; I bought one of those recepticle/USB things a while back and put it where we usually plug in our phones to charge.  Works really well, only the cord on the counter, and free ports to use too!
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF - BaileyJ  How many amps does it supply?
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF you mick is cutting out
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Ha! Defeated by the security packaging
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; yeah, I'm getting mic drops intermittently, too.
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; *microphone
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; wow, like that power cut off technology!
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I had a little when he was busy with the packaging, but otherwise it has been fine
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; no vampire current
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; We have similar units at Home Depot...
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; it is cutting out when he was moving side to side
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I think Belkin has green power strips that shut off
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; iPad needs 2.1 amps iirc
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; it should have 12V for leds, not 5V for USB :)
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; 20A?  sheesh
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; nice graphics, @RobbieF
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; you're not going to get a shock? then what's the point of doing it, where's the fun?
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; agreed
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; I do it live or not at all !!  I'm a risk taker.
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; (and I'm stupid too....)
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Might want to use a meter and test it is off
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; here we use coloured cables, because there is no way to see the difference between white, gray and black in the dark
&lt;b&gt;Guest_4988:&lt;/b&gt; are they available in uk
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Guest_4988, similar units, yes
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Usual home centre stores should have them
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; worry if you break off too much amd no slack
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; When Robbie turns his head to his right (far right
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, but it is AC, there is no right and wrong side, except for the earth-part, which is labelled with a different easy to indicate colour. Oh wait, thats only in the civilized world
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; oh, they are in a lot of different types at &lt;a href="http://cat5.tv/power" target="_blank"&gt;http://cat5.tv/power&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We still live in the past... no smartphones or tablets yet
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; US price is pretty good.
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, I'm totally anonymous! :P
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; I am in the Chat room!
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Many of the wall warts don't have enough amps for iPads
&lt;b&gt;napa_polarbear:&lt;/b&gt; hi
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; of course!!  THANKS
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; PPl use them for Raspberry Pi power supplies
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I am just wondering when induction plates will be common.
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; yes agamotto, waiting for induction
&lt;b&gt;oldsalt:&lt;/b&gt; hello everyone
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy: those plugs? that is a great idea
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I like it also
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Charge my antique Zune v1
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I thought the idea was to remove the keyboard from mobile devices?
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, qwerty was invted quite a while ago with type-writers, so they are a few hundred years too late if they want to sue
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; ~135 years
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; patent lawyers get rich
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps the WTO should do something useful about it
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; Hijacking DNS
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; certificate will be bad
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; malware-writers have been doing it for years :)
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Steve Gibson did a show on that iirc
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Censoring governments should have their assets frozen
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; It is on his web site
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; They can substitute a false site that looks the same
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; if they wanted,they could do man in the middle too, and then everything would be valid
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I did something similar when I was a programmer.. I pretended a coworker got an I/O error and lost his entire library
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Yet another reason to not use Office
&lt;b&gt;oaesystemstech:&lt;/b&gt; There is a reason to log on as a user and not as the administrator
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I am safe... I use IE 8 :-)
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; oh no RobbieFs dryer is hacked by criminals! or something
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; We are using IE 10 or 11 at work... yech
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; typical repiar person
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; yoss it out and buy a 2000 dollar dryer
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; ATM's are mostly XP
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; just popped in
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy: Please don't bring ATMs into this.
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; anyone who likes money... easy pickings
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; who is the cohost
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; They are specialized applications.
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; The ATM threat is absolutely bogus.
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; more landfill trash piles up
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Bailey invinciblemutant
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; ATM's aren't browsing to random websites and clicking random links. Or installing all kinds of software. They are *embedded* systems designed to do a very specific task and nothing else.
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; All your computer are belong to us
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; BaileyJ: stop swivelling on the chair...:P
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; ATMs are connected to the web, these days through permanent connections, so they are a potential risk, just like any other computer
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; MY XP has a bot I think
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; _Jot_: No, they are connected to an *intranet* which has layers and layers of firewalls and other protection.
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Spybot Search &amp; Destroy
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; goodone talky_toaster
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Malwarebytes is showing outbound connections to malicious IP's
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Garbee, they are supposed to connect to an intranet, but often are not, because it is too expensive. Here they just use whatever is available, which is often consumer lines
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; agamotto: wow I've not thought of that program in ages
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; You would think it would just be easier to put a condom on the ethernet port...
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; @RobbieF: be good to your dryer (future overlord)
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Microsoft has to love that.. sell Win 8.. They stopped selling copies of Win 7 supposedly
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; the dryer has the potential to put your clothes on fire. So yeah, you should be good to it
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy:  Just buy your copy of 7 from HP... they seem to have no trouble getting ahold of it
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; BaileyJ: you are doing well
&lt;b&gt;oaesystemstech:&lt;/b&gt; Who watches the watchers?
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; lol
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; omg, RobbieF appears to be getting hair again...
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; suspended sentence, for making millions of dollars, sounds like a great deal. In other words, crime pays
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; That'll show him
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; a wig
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Reminds me of a story about the BSA using copywritten images on its website... w/o creators' permission of course.
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; tough sentences like that will deter others
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; suspended
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; in my country, the music used by the copyright-maffia was stolen and not paid for
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Only if they wind up suspended from a bridge...
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; So RobbieF, did you get rich suddenly? :)
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; suspended for 4 years?
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; what does it mean?
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; suspended sentence means no jail now, but if you do it again, you'll have to do the sentence
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; we're fine RobbieF
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; Saluton, sinjoro! Kiel vi fartas?
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, but got off easy the first attempt... make a ton of money with little risk
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; withdraw me too ..:P
&lt;b&gt;oldsalt:&lt;/b&gt; passwordbox is great
&lt;b&gt;RavenLords:&lt;/b&gt; hello everyone
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; you don't want more stickers, invinciblemutant?
&lt;b&gt;tic-toc:&lt;/b&gt; Might as well withdraw my name too, I never win anything....lol
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; hello RavenLords
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; Any viewers were on mh37*, can RobbieF track them down
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; BaileyJ, Megan was on episode 332
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; and RObbieF
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; He tumbled and spun in the air, swooping and diving in a salute to the the RavenLord!
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Maeghan I should say
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Death Cert, id, and your 'custodian' password, I would imagine
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; that is neat? no you would be dead!
&lt;b&gt;oaesystemstech:&lt;/b&gt; But NSA is shorter!
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; is it legitimate for a spouse to take over an account after one dies, such as a bank account
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; What kind of stuff? I wasn't paying attention.
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Depends on the will
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; meh, I'll rewatch later and comment on the show page.
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We have one that covers that and the children etc
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; You would have a key from 'owner', one from 'custodian' plus death cert to verify expiration... both needed to generate 'magic' key if memory serves
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; oh, RobbieF if they know what SSH is, the crypto should basically work like that.
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; i Like it also!
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; But, a more detailed explenation for normal people... That would take me some time.
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I give my wife my master password... nothing to hide
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: is it safe to store my embanking password in passwordbox
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; ?
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; ebanking
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy: because you are a good guy
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: Well, trade secrets should not revolve around your crypto.
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; grandma's password cookies recipe...
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; That would be one of the excellent uses for it, yes
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; or they say that to avoid showing it is not that strong
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; If it isn't publicly viewable for assessment, it isn't trustable crypto.
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, we already know your password is 1234
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Security thru obscurity does not work
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Nah, NKOTB
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: is it a good idea to put all eggs in a single basket
&lt;b&gt;tic-toc:&lt;/b&gt; What if you get hit in the head and get Amnesia....lol
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I got amnesia? I don't remember that
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; what if the master password is captured a key logger
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Darren oon HAK5 wrote a small program to store clipboard contents
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; Darren Kitchen
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Most pw software uses the clipboard to enter them
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; my password is Password
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I type slow, so it became Darren lol
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; 32?  1024... now we are talking
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; once the master password is captured by a key logger, all gone !!!
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; true
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, there's other shows? Thanks for letting me know, have to go watch them. Bye!
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; You mean there are twits outside of Twitter?
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; Yea, ATM's are *not* an issue being kept on XP Embedded unless your banks network is *very POORLY* implemented.
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; XYplorer is one
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Total Commander
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: This is XP *EMBEDDED* Not true Windows XP you run on the desktop.
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; there are differences, but not that much really
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; depends on what you selected to add to the installation
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Steve G. is very knowlegable ...but this is really scary.....he has been saying thios for a couple of weeks now .No one else I've heard is agreeing with him!
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Hmmm, use something obscure like AmigaDOS... security through obsolescense.
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; he's been saying it for years I'd say :
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; they share the same kernel, and a few of the APIs, but other than that they aren't really the same. You can't say something that affects XP will affect XP Embedded, unless they are *kernel* level issues. And even then, the vector of attack for them to be introduced to the system is far smaller than a general desktop.
&lt;b&gt;tic-toc:&lt;/b&gt; Someones going to naughty sites at work
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; My wifes pc wont run Win7 +
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: Unless it isn't connected to a network. As specialized medical equipment is, which runs on XP embedded as well.
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I have to admit.. AT&amp;T does a very good job of blocking that sort of thing
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; do you think windows 95 or 3.11 viruses still exist?
&lt;b&gt;Dreamer__:&lt;/b&gt; 1
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; of course a limited XP like embedded is more secure by default, but for example, my XP is far behind firewalls, so you can't even port-scan it, and doesn't connect to unknown addresses, so you don't need a limited XP to be secure
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; She runs Ubuntu 10.4 mostly, but boots WinXP for a few special apps
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; both my computers will not install windows 8 and they are new computers
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; yes, windows 95 and dos etc virusses still work
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; even worse, modern antivirus often doesn't scan for them
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://twit.tv/show/security-now/447" target="_blank"&gt;http://twit.tv/show/security-now/447&lt;/a&gt; --The episode of Security Now that covered the ATM issue.
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; can't see it
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Our Ooma ip phone does fax also
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; oh hey DrawBot
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-447.txt" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-447.txt&lt;/a&gt;  --Text shownotes for it as well.
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; which is fine as I am dumping windows completely for Linux
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; video stopped
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; So does Obihai I gave to our daughter
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; they work great on beer glasses
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; video came back choppy, and stopped again.
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Our last XCP machine will be pulled on Monday
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Wow... I think I actually put too much garlic on something
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; a bit late, but better late than never Doggiedriver
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; fortunatly most XP computers will run linux just fine
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; not with old AMD chips
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, you always have trouble with reading :P
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy, eh?
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; no PAE support and most kernels use that nowadays

&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Thanks everyone
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; Tried Garbee....trying again.
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Garamond vs Comic Sans...
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; And i was late.
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; kyoshininja: Maybe there is something wrong with Youtube and you... ?
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; Or it could just be Live buggyness with Youtube. It is still a relatively recent addition.
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I would vote for YouTube sillyness
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Jot- The rest are Mint 13 LTS
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; Garbee: yes, trying another machine...
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; VLC has chopiness often too, but you can try that
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Cohost again BaileyJ

&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; night gpop7
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Nite all
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you all!
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Love Mint
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, I coded it GoodGuy.
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Jot. I should send a email to robbief
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; How did you learn how?
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I never tried Mint myself, usually stick with Debian
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; They have a Mint Debian also
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; gpop7, just email live@category5.tv with your username, email-address, and that you won and such, and RobbieF will walk over all the way to the postoffice and demand to sticker the whole place if they don't send you some :)
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; LMDE on P$ Laptops ...works just fine
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I have a thing about software written by Vorlons...  (very inside joke)
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; P4
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; email-adress, ha! I man snailmail-address obviously. Email will be included automaticly, most of the time :)
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you.
&lt;b&gt;robgor:&lt;/b&gt; seya guys
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; see you robgor
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; night RobbieF
&lt;b&gt;Leland_:&lt;/b&gt; Ultimte Edition 2.6 Rocks!
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Well, I must away... I need to give a certain pooch a bath before her bedtime
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; meant robgor
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; have a nice time agamotto
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; see you agamotto
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I should be here for next week's show
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; I understood what you meant. Thanks again.
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; See you hopefully next week same time same station. I hope i will not be late.
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; fortunatly you can always watch episodes again so even if you are a bit late, no big deal :)
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; It would have rearranged my face and not for the better
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Bad skinned knee was all i ended up with besides aches and pains
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; I am glad that you did not do that. You were blessed.
&lt;b&gt;Leland_:&lt;/b&gt; Some time it's better to miss the point.
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; And your pride I know
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I fell last summer also and hit the side of our car
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; lol Leland_
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy, maybe next time try to miss the ground when you fall
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; lol _Jot_
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; yeah try to fall up
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Not down
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We had a new driveway installed last fall and need to fill dirt around the edges
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I was trying to carry a couple packages for my wife and two coats for me
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; if theres enough room put some nice plants and such, soft ones so if you fall, you have a choice between soft foliage and hard concrete
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; wasn't watching where I went
&lt;b&gt;Leland_:&lt;/b&gt; Try falling slower.
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; at least you were trying to be a good guy :)
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Ok i am off to watch Agents of Sheilds. See you next week.
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; have a nice time gpop7
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; There isn't. my wife asked them to install extra concrete so she could get out of the car easier
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; \You too.
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; night gpop7
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Later Goodguy
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We just missed the all-time record for snowfall this winter by 2.7 inches
&lt;b&gt;Leland_:&lt;/b&gt; In guys in Canada coud get away with just installing more snow, instead of conrete.
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Record was set in 1880-1881
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; weather seems to be getting more unpredictable and erratic lately
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Most ppl wanted the record after living with that much snow
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; They said global warming was making it warmer in the far north and pushing artic cold down lower
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I wouldn't be suprised if there were places with more snow than the record, but these records are measured at the same place
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Local supermarket had t-shirts for sale.... I survived Polar Vortex 2014
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I am not sure.. probably in Detroit
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; It was more rural in 1880's
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; so less heat from plants, offices and homes
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; brbias
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Sunny and 15 C  in Campbell river BC (Canada)
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; in my country its about 5-8c but also some extremes to 12c at the south right now, at 2am, which is about average, but on the high side, especially for nighttime
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; Hi all!
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; hey RobbieF
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; sorry; just had to get some pictures of Bailey for the web site.
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; all done
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; she looked fine
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; not sure the colours where right on my screen, very little purple anywhere, but maybe I'll put a purple filter in front of it next time, so I don't anger the Bailey-gods :)
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; hi RobbieF
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; Hey GoodGuy. Nice to see you
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; it was a very purple pen
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; and mine was very pink
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I bought a Raspberry Pi at Microcenter (locally)... It was only $29.999 (USA)
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; nice!
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; very cheap
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Not sure if it was a sale.. price tag said $39.99, but rang up as $29.99
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; How'd the new live page work out?
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I have not seen them discounted before
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; They have a good selectiobn of Pi addons, Arduino , Bealboard etc
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; I am setting my Raspberry pi as a Media Server, should be cool
