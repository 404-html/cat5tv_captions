00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
&lt;b&gt;keckeckec:&lt;/b&gt; We're having fun already

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; New face, but old person?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; welcome Bailey J Thomspon, or BaileyJ as she's known here :)

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; New face, but old person/me chuckles

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
&lt;b&gt;FBTV-Gunnar-Swed:&lt;/b&gt; It works :)

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Nicely done, anonymous _Jot

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; yeah, nobody will know it was me, it's totally anonymous!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; wow, that's a voice...

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Hmmm, we have a Taelon on the cast?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I just had to protect my speakers with all that static previously :)

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I take it audio has been rough the last few episodes?  I am still catching up

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; Bailey should do voiceovers for demon possession movies with that voice...

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; lol kyoshininja

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; no, audio was great, but they had Hillary over as well, and she was forced to use the wireless microphone, which then did the thing it used to do a lot, completely static drowning out everything

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Is BaileyJ the author on a show in the past or am I mixing things up?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
&lt;b&gt;IMTech5:&lt;/b&gt; Hi All...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
&lt;b&gt;FBTV-Gunnar-Swed:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF has to trim the mic :)

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Hmm, Robbie could teach my local tv stations somethings about audio clarity

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; that's correct GoodGuy! She was at 269 ( &lt;a href="http://www.category5.tv/episodes/269.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.category5.tv/episodes/269.php&lt;/a&gt; )

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; Oh, that's nice...sweet voice now...

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; nice friendly look to match

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; I finally got sound

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Here's a link to the shops so you don't even have to type: &lt;a href="http://shop.category5.tv" target="_blank"&gt;http://shop.category5.tv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cat5.tv/roku" target="_blank"&gt;http://cat5.tv/roku&lt;/a&gt;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Yeah... I update my Roku every day looking for it

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; As long as you have a ~5mbit or faster connection

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We cut the cable a month ago

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; Hello GoodGuy

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy, congrats!  I sure don't miss it

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Roku has a lot of streaming info

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; BOOM!  I'm here!

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
&lt;b&gt;napa_polarbear:&lt;/b&gt; hi robbi

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I thougt that was her!

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; welcome talky_toaster

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
&lt;b&gt;IMTech5:&lt;/b&gt; Hey talky_toaster

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Robbie needs his Gollum juice

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Baileys Biography is at: &lt;a href="http://www.category5.tv/bios/bailey-j-thompson.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.category5.tv/bios/bailey-j-thompson.php&lt;/a&gt;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; didn;t she drive to the show?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Wow, and I thought I was eccentric for my fixation on fountain pens...

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; Heyooo people!

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; My first girlfriend bought her first car in purple

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; BaileyJ, so do you need a pen that uses purple ink? or a pen that is purple? Or specifically a purple pen that writes with purple ink?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
&lt;b&gt;BaileyJ:&lt;/b&gt; ppurple ink

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; ROBBIE--&gt; product placement, move your PC pop outta frame!

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; haha nice

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
&lt;b&gt;napa_polarbear:&lt;/b&gt; my bd on the 3

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; agamotto: fountain pens rule..

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Hillary, you recognized it, I couldn't even tell wht it was :)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; Hello Hillaryyyyy

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Does BaileyJ run Linux?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; I loose pens all the time ... I got sick of not caring ... so I bough a $20 pen.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; so you stick with cheap pens, talky_toaster :)

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; It's Canadian Jot...President's Choice...which makes no sense bc we have a Prime Minister..

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; now you will care when you lose it :-)

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I find that writing with Biro/paste pens is too much like writing in mud.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000
&lt;b&gt;Hillaryyyyy:&lt;/b&gt; LOL!

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, try scissors

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; wall warts

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; I bought one of those recepticle/USB things a while back and put it where we usually plug in our phones to charge.  Works really well, only the cord on the counter, and free ports to use too!

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF - BaileyJ  How many amps does it supply?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF you mick is cutting out

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Ha! Defeated by the security packaging

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; yeah, I'm getting mic drops intermittently, too.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; *microphone

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; wow, like that power cut off technology!

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I had a little when he was busy with the packaging, but otherwise it has been fine

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.000
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; no vampire current

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; We have similar units at Home Depot...

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; it is cutting out when he was moving side to side

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I think Belkin has green power strips that shut off

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; iPad needs 2.1 amps iirc

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; it should have 12V for leds, not 5V for USB :)

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; 20A?  sheesh

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; nice graphics, @RobbieF

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; you're not going to get a shock? then what's the point of doing it, where's the fun?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:12.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; agreed

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; I do it live or not at all !!  I'm a risk taker.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; (and I'm stupid too....)

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Might want to use a meter and test it is off

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:56.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; here we use coloured cables, because there is no way to see the difference between white, gray and black in the dark

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:07.000
&lt;b&gt;Guest_4988:&lt;/b&gt; are they available in uk

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:28.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Guest_4988, similar units, yes

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Usual home centre stores should have them

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; worry if you break off too much amd no slack

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; When Robbie turns his head to his right (far right

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, but it is AC, there is no right and wrong side, except for the earth-part, which is labelled with a different easy to indicate colour. Oh wait, thats only in the civilized world

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:51.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; oh, they are in a lot of different types at &lt;a href="http://cat5.tv/power" target="_blank"&gt;http://cat5.tv/power&lt;/a&gt;

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We still live in the past... no smartphones or tablets yet

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; US price is pretty good.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:18.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, I'm totally anonymous! :P

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; I am in the Chat room!

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Many of the wall warts don't have enough amps for iPads

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
&lt;b&gt;napa_polarbear:&lt;/b&gt; hi

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; of course!!  THANKS

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:05.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; PPl use them for Raspberry Pi power supplies

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I am just wondering when induction plates will be common.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
&lt;b&gt;BobK54:&lt;/b&gt; yes agamotto, waiting for induction

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
&lt;b&gt;oldsalt:&lt;/b&gt; hello everyone

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy: those plugs? that is a great idea

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I like it also

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Charge my antique Zune v1

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I thought the idea was to remove the keyboard from mobile devices?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:30.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, qwerty was invted quite a while ago with type-writers, so they are a few hundred years too late if they want to sue

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:55.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; ~135 years

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:04.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; patent lawyers get rich

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:52.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps the WTO should do something useful about it

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:31.000
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; Hijacking DNS

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; certificate will be bad

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:45.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; malware-writers have been doing it for years :)

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Steve Gibson did a show on that iirc

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Censoring governments should have their assets frozen

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; It is on his web site

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; They can substitute a false site that looks the same

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:14.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; if they wanted,they could do man in the middle too, and then everything would be valid

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I did something similar when I was a programmer.. I pretended a coworker got an I/O error and lost his entire library

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:10.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Yet another reason to not use Office

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:40.000
&lt;b&gt;oaesystemstech:&lt;/b&gt; There is a reason to log on as a user and not as the administrator

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:48.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I am safe... I use IE 8 :-)

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:00.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; oh no RobbieFs dryer is hacked by criminals! or something

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:20.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; We are using IE 10 or 11 at work... yech

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:36.000
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; typical repiar person

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; yoss it out and buy a 2000 dollar dryer

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; ATM's are mostly XP

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; just popped in

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy: Please don't bring ATMs into this.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; anyone who likes money... easy pickings

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; who is the cohost

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; They are specialized applications.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; The ATM threat is absolutely bogus.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:32.000
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; more landfill trash piles up

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Bailey invinciblemutant

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; ATM's aren't browsing to random websites and clicking random links. Or installing all kinds of software. They are *embedded* systems designed to do a very specific task and nothing else.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:29.000
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; All your computer are belong to us

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; BaileyJ: stop swivelling on the chair...:P

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; ATMs are connected to the web, these days through permanent connections, so they are a potential risk, just like any other computer

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; MY XP has a bot I think

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; _Jot_: No, they are connected to an *intranet* which has layers and layers of firewalls and other protection.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:26.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Spybot Search &amp; Destroy

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; goodone talky_toaster

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Malwarebytes is showing outbound connections to malicious IP's

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Garbee, they are supposed to connect to an intranet, but often are not, because it is too expensive. Here they just use whatever is available, which is often consumer lines

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:51.000
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; agamotto: wow I've not thought of that program in ages

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:07.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; You would think it would just be easier to put a condom on the ethernet port...

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; @RobbieF: be good to your dryer (future overlord)

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:34.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Microsoft has to love that.. sell Win 8.. They stopped selling copies of Win 7 supposedly

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:43.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; the dryer has the potential to put your clothes on fire. So yeah, you should be good to it

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:14.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy:  Just buy your copy of 7 from HP... they seem to have no trouble getting ahold of it

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:25.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; BaileyJ: you are doing well

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:16.000
&lt;b&gt;oaesystemstech:&lt;/b&gt; Who watches the watchers?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; lol

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; omg, RobbieF appears to be getting hair again...

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; suspended sentence, for making millions of dollars, sounds like a great deal. In other words, crime pays

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; That'll show him

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:37.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; a wig

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Reminds me of a story about the BSA using copywritten images on its website... w/o creators' permission of course.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:00.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; tough sentences like that will deter others

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; suspended

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; in my country, the music used by the copyright-maffia was stolen and not paid for

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:51.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Only if they wind up suspended from a bridge...

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; So RobbieF, did you get rich suddenly? :)

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; suspended for 4 years?

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:19.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; what does it mean?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:40.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; suspended sentence means no jail now, but if you do it again, you'll have to do the sentence

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:54.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; we're fine RobbieF

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; Saluton, sinjoro! Kiel vi fartas?

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:22.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, but got off easy the first attempt... make a ton of money with little risk

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; withdraw me too ..:P

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
&lt;b&gt;oldsalt:&lt;/b&gt; passwordbox is great

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
&lt;b&gt;RavenLords:&lt;/b&gt; hello everyone

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; you don't want more stickers, invinciblemutant?

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.000
&lt;b&gt;tic-toc:&lt;/b&gt; Might as well withdraw my name too, I never win anything....lol

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:49.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; hello RavenLords

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:20.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; Any viewers were on mh37*, can RobbieF track them down

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; BaileyJ, Megan was on episode 332

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; and RObbieF

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; He tumbled and spun in the air, swooping and diving in a salute to the the RavenLord!

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:47.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; Maeghan I should say

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:28.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Death Cert, id, and your 'custodian' password, I would imagine

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:50.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; that is neat? no you would be dead!

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:14.000
&lt;b&gt;oaesystemstech:&lt;/b&gt; But NSA is shorter!

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; is it legitimate for a spouse to take over an account after one dies, such as a bank account

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:38.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; What kind of stuff? I wasn't paying attention.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Depends on the will

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; meh, I'll rewatch later and comment on the show page.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:13.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We have one that covers that and the children etc

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:41.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; You would have a key from 'owner', one from 'custodian' plus death cert to verify expiration... both needed to generate 'magic' key if memory serves

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:51.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; oh, RobbieF if they know what SSH is, the crypto should basically work like that.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:02.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; i Like it also!

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:26.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; But, a more detailed explenation for normal people... That would take me some time.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I give my wife my master password... nothing to hide

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: is it safe to store my embanking password in passwordbox

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; ?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:51.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; ebanking

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy: because you are a good guy

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: Well, trade secrets should not revolve around your crypto.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; grandma's password cookies recipe...

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; That would be one of the excellent uses for it, yes

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:21.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; or they say that to avoid showing it is not that strong

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; If it isn't publicly viewable for assessment, it isn't trustable crypto.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:38.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, we already know your password is 1234

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Security thru obscurity does not work

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:58.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Nah, NKOTB

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: is it a good idea to put all eggs in a single basket

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:16.000
&lt;b&gt;tic-toc:&lt;/b&gt; What if you get hit in the head and get Amnesia....lol

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I got amnesia? I don't remember that

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:30.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; what if the master password is captured a key logger

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:38.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Darren oon HAK5 wrote a small program to store clipboard contents

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
&lt;b&gt;talky_toaster:&lt;/b&gt; Darren Kitchen

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Most pw software uses the clipboard to enter them

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:58.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; my password is Password

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:27.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I type slow, so it became Darren lol

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; 32?  1024... now we are talking

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:44.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; once the master password is captured by a key logger, all gone !!!

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; true

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, there's other shows? Thanks for letting me know, have to go watch them. Bye!

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; You mean there are twits outside of Twitter?

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; Yea, ATM's are *not* an issue being kept on XP Embedded unless your banks network is *very POORLY* implemented.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:31.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; XYplorer is one

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:48.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Total Commander

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:29.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: This is XP *EMBEDDED* Not true Windows XP you run on the desktop.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:00.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; there are differences, but not that much really

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:13.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; depends on what you selected to add to the installation

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:38.000
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Steve G. is very knowlegable ...but this is really scary.....he has been saying thios for a couple of weeks now .No one else I've heard is agreeing with him!

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Hmmm, use something obscure like AmigaDOS... security through obsolescense.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; he's been saying it for years I'd say :

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; they share the same kernel, and a few of the APIs, but other than that they aren't really the same. You can't say something that affects XP will affect XP Embedded, unless they are *kernel* level issues. And even then, the vector of attack for them to be introduced to the system is far smaller than a general desktop.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:59.000
&lt;b&gt;tic-toc:&lt;/b&gt; Someones going to naughty sites at work

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; My wifes pc wont run Win7 +

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:51.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF: Unless it isn't connected to a network. As specialized medical equipment is, which runs on XP embedded as well.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I have to admit.. AT&amp;T does a very good job of blocking that sort of thing

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:03.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; do you think windows 95 or 3.11 viruses still exist?

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000
&lt;b&gt;Dreamer__:&lt;/b&gt; 1

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:19.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; of course a limited XP like embedded is more secure by default, but for example, my XP is far behind firewalls, so you can't even port-scan it, and doesn't connect to unknown addresses, so you don't need a limited XP to be secure

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; She runs Ubuntu 10.4 mostly, but boots WinXP for a few special apps

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; both my computers will not install windows 8 and they are new computers

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:30.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; yes, windows 95 and dos etc virusses still work

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:38.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; even worse, modern antivirus often doesn't scan for them

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://twit.tv/show/security-now/447" target="_blank"&gt;http://twit.tv/show/security-now/447&lt;/a&gt; --The episode of Security Now that covered the ATM issue.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
&lt;b&gt;invinciblemutant:&lt;/b&gt; can't see it

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Our Ooma ip phone does fax also

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; oh hey DrawBot

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-447.txt" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-447.txt&lt;/a&gt;  --Text shownotes for it as well.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000
&lt;b&gt;gee:&lt;/b&gt; which is fine as I am dumping windows completely for Linux

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; video stopped

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:06.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; So does Obihai I gave to our daughter

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:34.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; they work great on beer glasses

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; video came back choppy, and stopped again.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.000
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Our last XCP machine will be pulled on Monday

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:18.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Wow... I think I actually put too much garlic on something

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:29.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; a bit late, but better late than never Doggiedriver

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:45.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; fortunatly most XP computers will run linux just fine

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; not with old AMD chips

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; RobbieF, you always have trouble with reading :P

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy, eh?

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:24.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; no PAE support and most kernels use that nowadays

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:36.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; ahhh

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; congratulations gpop7

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:49.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Only an old flash works on the old AMD's

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:01.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; congrats

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Yeah gpop7

&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Thanks everyone

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:50.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; Tried Garbee....trying again.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:58.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Garamond vs Comic Sans...

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; And i was late.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; kyoshininja: Maybe there is something wrong with Youtube and you... ?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:32.000
&lt;b&gt;Garbee:&lt;/b&gt; Or it could just be Live buggyness with Youtube. It is still a relatively recent addition.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I would vote for YouTube sillyness

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Jot- The rest are Mint 13 LTS

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
&lt;b&gt;kyoshininja:&lt;/b&gt; Garbee: yes, trying another machine...

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:08.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; VLC has chopiness often too, but you can try that

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Cohost again BaileyJ

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:11.000
&lt;b&gt;IMTech5:&lt;/b&gt; Good nite all...

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; WinXP dies and Cat5 Roku is born!

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; night IMTech5

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Good night everyone. Have a great week.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Hmmm, should see a new LTS Mint sometime in May I would think

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
&lt;b&gt;IMTech5:&lt;/b&gt; Thanks @RobbieF and @BaileyJ!

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
&lt;b&gt;FBTV-Gunnar-Swed:&lt;/b&gt; Night :)

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; night gpop7

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Nite all

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:57.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you all!

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Love Mint

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, I coded it GoodGuy.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Jot. I should send a email to robbief

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:17.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; How did you learn how?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:29.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I never tried Mint myself, usually stick with Debian

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:43.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; They have a Mint Debian also

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:06.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:13.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; gpop7, just email live@category5.tv with your username, email-address, and that you won and such, and RobbieF will walk over all the way to the postoffice and demand to sticker the whole place if they don't send you some :)

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; LMDE on P$ Laptops ...works just fine

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:22.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I have a thing about software written by Vorlons...  (very inside joke)

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.000
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; P4

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:41.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; email-adress, ha! I man snailmail-address obviously. Email will be included automaticly, most of the time :)

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:55.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000
&lt;b&gt;robgor:&lt;/b&gt; seya guys

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; see you robgor

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; night RobbieF

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
&lt;b&gt;Leland_:&lt;/b&gt; Ultimte Edition 2.6 Rocks!

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; Well, I must away... I need to give a certain pooch a bath before her bedtime

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; meant robgor

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:48.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; have a nice time agamotto

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:56.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; see you agamotto

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
&lt;b&gt;agamotto:&lt;/b&gt; I should be here for next week's show

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:08.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; I understood what you meant. Thanks again.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; See you hopefully next week same time same station. I hope i will not be late.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; fortunatly you can always watch episodes again so even if you are a bit late, no big deal :)

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:46.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; It would have rearranged my face and not for the better

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:18.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Bad skinned knee was all i ended up with besides aches and pains

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; I am glad that you did not do that. You were blessed.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:44.000
&lt;b&gt;Leland_:&lt;/b&gt; Some time it's better to miss the point.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; And your pride I know

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I fell last summer also and hit the side of our car

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; lol Leland_

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:09.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; GoodGuy, maybe next time try to miss the ground when you fall

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:19.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; lol _Jot_

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:33.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; yeah try to fall up

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:49.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Not down

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:57.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We had a new driveway installed last fall and need to fill dirt around the edges

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I was trying to carry a couple packages for my wife and two coats for me

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; if theres enough room put some nice plants and such, soft ones so if you fall, you have a choice between soft foliage and hard concrete

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:45.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; wasn't watching where I went

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
&lt;b&gt;Leland_:&lt;/b&gt; Try falling slower.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:05.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; at least you were trying to be a good guy :)

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:13.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Ok i am off to watch Agents of Sheilds. See you next week.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:22.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; have a nice time gpop7

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:30.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; There isn't. my wife asked them to install extra concrete so she could get out of the car easier

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:38.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; \You too.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:46.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; night gpop7

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:09.000
&lt;b&gt;gpop7:&lt;/b&gt; Later Goodguy

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; We just missed the all-time record for snowfall this winter by 2.7 inches

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:06.000
&lt;b&gt;Leland_:&lt;/b&gt; In guys in Canada coud get away with just installing more snow, instead of conrete.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:35.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Record was set in 1880-1881

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:57.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; weather seems to be getting more unpredictable and erratic lately

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Most ppl wanted the record after living with that much snow

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; They said global warming was making it warmer in the far north and pushing artic cold down lower

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:00.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; I wouldn't be suprised if there were places with more snow than the record, but these records are measured at the same place

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:34.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Local supermarket had t-shirts for sale.... I survived Polar Vortex 2014

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:56.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I am not sure.. probably in Detroit

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:10.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; It was more rural in 1880's

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; so less heat from plants, offices and homes

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; brbias

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:48.000
&lt;b&gt;Doggiedriver:&lt;/b&gt; Sunny and 15 C  in Campbell river BC (Canada)

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:06.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; in my country its about 5-8c but also some extremes to 12c at the south right now, at 2am, which is about average, but on the high side, especially for nighttime

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:51.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; Hi all!

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; hey RobbieF

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; sorry; just had to get some pictures of Bailey for the web site.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:02.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; all done

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:20.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; she looked fine

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:59.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; not sure the colours where right on my screen, very little purple anywhere, but maybe I'll put a purple filter in front of it next time, so I don't anger the Bailey-gods :)

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:07.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; hi RobbieF

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:21.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; Hey GoodGuy. Nice to see you

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; it was a very purple pen

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; and mine was very pink

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:42.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I bought a Raspberry Pi at Microcenter (locally)... It was only $29.999 (USA)

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:53.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; nice!

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:03.000
&lt;b&gt;_Jot_:&lt;/b&gt; very cheap

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; Not sure if it was a sale.. price tag said $39.99, but rang up as $29.99

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
&lt;b&gt;RobbieF:&lt;/b&gt; How'd the new live page work out?

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:38.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; I have not seen them discounted before

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:18.000
&lt;b&gt;GoodGuy:&lt;/b&gt; They have a good selectiobn of Pi addons, Arduino , Bealboard etc

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.000
&lt;b&gt;Dennis_Kelley:&lt;/b&gt; I am setting my Raspberry pi as a Media Server, should be cool
