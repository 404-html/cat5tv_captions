home and and do some schoolwork and

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,260
because she's enrolled in doing some

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,780
master's work and so I had some holiday

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:03,100
time and I'm like I told Jane all about

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,530
my Midwest America adventure and she's

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,990
like I would be totally into going with

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,150
that are with you on that so here we are

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,790

regular Watchers of the show you will

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,840
watched before where Jane joined us and

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,420
we talked about finances huh and then

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,720
she joined me on our trip to Ghana West

26
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:26,050
Africa and I asked her to join us on the

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,490
show for that so she is one of our I

28
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:32,770
want to say regular guest one of our

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,500
regular guests on the show so here we

30
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:39,610
are in Midwest America we are currently

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,409
in the upper northeast part of Oklahoma

32
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:45,940
which is like in the middle it's known

33
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:50,049
as an oil state and one of the things

34
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:53,080
that we've talked about on this journey

35
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:59,619
are signs and right at the very

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:02:03,490
beginning of our trip yes yes Kuwait we

37
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:06,310
missed a very crucial sign so first of

38
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,360
all we were in Sioux sainte-marie we

39
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:13,090
were crossing into the United States in

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,430
into Sioux Michigan and the first sign

41
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,690
we missed was the sign that actually

42
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:22,080
took us to the border so we had to go

43
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,210
around the block and

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,080
and try a second time before we actually

45
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,150
made it to the border crossing and then

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,870
the second crucial sign we missed was

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:40,260
just before we got to the border guard

48
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:45,030
haha and it was a stop sign and yeah he

49
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,420
was quite specific about the importance

50
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,800
of that sign and how it was there to

51
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,680
protect him as well as us and we had

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,060
missed the stop sign because that's what

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,450
he said he said did you see the stop

54
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,570
sign I said no and I was totally honest

55
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,890
like I did not see the stop sign he's

56
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,010
like well there was a sign and that's

57
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,810
there to protect me and I see one car at

58
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,070
a time he's like you know that you're in

59
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,370
the United States of America right now

60
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,900
and I'm like yes and he's like is this

61
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,670
where you want to be and I'm like yes

62
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,100
and you could tell that he was very

63
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,710
serious about his job and how important

64
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,900
it was to follow the signs in order to

65
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:29,240
make sure everybody was kept safe like

66
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:32,550
as Jane said not only him but us as well

67
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,200
and at that point we sort of just looked

68
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,540
at each other and said we in the last

69
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,870
five minutes have missed two very

70
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,880
important signs so we need to actually

71
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,790
stopped and prayed mm-hmm and we're like

72
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,530
do Lord Jesus like we're just in the

73
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,920
beginning of this adventure we need your

74
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,600
help

75
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,880
to make sure that we see the science

76
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,360
because signs are so important then like

77
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,280
a stop sign protects people at

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,030
intersections from hitting each other

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:04,650
they create space in between cars a

80
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,800
signs on a highway are very clear like

81
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,860
if you want to get off here then you

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,660
know it says in well you know in two in

83
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,790
two miles this is going to happen okay

84
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,310
in one mile this is going to happen so

85
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,989
they actually have signs that warn you

86
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,120
that the bigger sign is coming

87
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:24,000
and to take you off to where you need to

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,949
go and we didn't want to miss out on any

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,380
of the signs because right from the very

90
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,810
beginning we gave this adventure to the

91
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,930
Lord to say God wherever it is that you

92
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,449
would have us go and help us to see your

93
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,410
signs so that we will do what you want

94
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:45,960
us to do because yes it is on my bucket

95
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:47,580
list to see all 50 states and so I am in

96
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,860
the process of working my three appoint

97
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,919
myself through all 50 states and on this

98
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:57,710
trip we have seen Wisconsin and

99
00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:00,900
Minnesota Iowa Oklahoma Nebraska

100
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,970
Missouri in Kansas so we have seen seven

101
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,520
states so far and it's like check check

102
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,099
check check check but if if we don't

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,940
follow the signs then we're not gonna

104
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:13,169
see them and we don't want to miss out I

105
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,090
don't want to miss out on seeing

106
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:19,380
something because I didn't see a sign or

107
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:21,900
like that very first order crossing

108
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,479
guard I mean I like he could have very

109
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,229
easily have said sorry I'm not letting

110
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,220
you in because it was in his realm of

111
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:33,659
authority that he could do that because

112
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,610
I missed the sign and you might be

113
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:37,740
thinking so what does this have to do

114
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,680
with anything well the fact is God has

115
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,979
plans and purposes for us and Jeremiah

116
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,169
29:11 says I know the plans that I have

117
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:48,389
for you says Lord plans to prosper you

118
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:51,300
and not to harm you plans to give you

119
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,490
hope in the future and so God has plans

120
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,680
for us so you could almost think of it

121
00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:00,690
as like a blueprint for our life and

122
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,139
like very clear like he has plans for us

123
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,530
and he actually wants to convey that

124
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,090
plan for us and he does that through

125
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:12,199
sign

126
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:15,199
yeah and so some of the signs would be

127
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,860
through the Word of God through reading

128
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,710
the Scriptures right another way is

129
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,870
through prayer God's we speak to God God

130
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,240
speaks us God speaks us we speak back

131
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,490
it's a conversation thing another way

132
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,570
God speaks to us is through other people

133
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,139
uh-huh

134
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,370
and and so maybe Jane has been reading

135
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,229
something but the reason she's been

136
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,150
reading it is so that she can share it

137
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,160
with me right in conversation that's

138
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,970
another way that God speaks to us as a

139
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,610
sign from the Lord another way is

140
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,940
through dreams regular Lord speaks to us

141
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,040
through dreams and you can you might be

142
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,350
saying well what do you mean well if you

143
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,919
look at people in the Bible like David

144
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,169
Wow Joseph Joseph in the Old Testament

145
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,850
but also the father of the earth of the

146
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:05,389
father of Jesus Joseph in the New

147
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:10,010
Testament also Daniel Peter was given a

148
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:11,780
sign that of a vision of a cloth

149
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,880
falling from heaven full of all the

150
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,710
unclean foods and that was God declaring

151
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,680
to Peter at that point in time that he

152
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,660
was declaring all things good to eat and

153
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,950
so God speaks to us through the Word of

154
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,930
God through prayer through people

155
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,270
through dreams and sometimes it's just

156
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,310
the the tap tap tap of the Holy Spirit

157
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,560
that says and the whisper like I want

158
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,599
you to go here or circumstances or

159
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,220
circumstances I was thinking last night

160
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,599
the circumstance right right and so we

161
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,000
want you to hold on to that for a minute

162
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,260
we just said circumstances because we do

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,520
have a story to tell you about that as

164
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,580
change is said what I was thinking about

165
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,490
that from last night so at this point we

166
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,550
want you to pause and think about when

167
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,610
God might have spoken to you through

168
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:57,560
circumstances in order to direct you

169
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,810
into a different path for his purposes

170
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,070

224
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:35,939
we're back we're talking about signs and

225
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:38,459
how important it is that we see signs

226
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:40,079
and that God speaks to us through his

227
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,479
word through prayer through people

228
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,879
through dreams and entering

229
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:46,649
circumstances and so we pause there for

230
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,919
a little bit and I want to say to you

231
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:53,639
what exactly how would you explain

232
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:57,359
circumstances to our viewers right can

233
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,729
you give an example right so have you

234
00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:01,799
ever had this isn't my example but have

235
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:04,679
you ever had a situation where you're

236
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,809
driving and you have a specific

237
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,629
destination you need to get to and

238
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,279
you're on a time crunch and you hit

239
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:15,419
traffic and you're then in stop-and-go

240
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,669
traffic and all you can think about is I

241
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:20,249
just need to get to where I need to get

242
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:23,279
to why is this happening to me so to me

243
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:25,679
that would be an indication of that's a

244
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,529
circumstance that God has allowed in

245
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,869
your life at that moment and we often

246
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,830
have a tendency of thinking just get me

247
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:38,340
through it instead of pausing and say

248
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:39,930
Lord Jesus I choose to believe that you

249
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,940
have a different plan for me so just

250
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,850
help me to receive that plan and help me

251
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,620
to stay here in the moment and be who

252
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,170
you need to be because you have chosen

253
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,540
to allow me to be at this moment on this

254
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:56,130
part of the highway right now right here

255
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:59,070
so just let me be here right sometimes

256
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,990
it's you have a plan of doing one

257
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,540
particular thing and not just no matter

258
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:07,160
how hard you try it doesn't come to

259
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:10,710
fruition and you wonder why sometimes

260
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,350
you think everything is going okay and

261
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,750
then something different happens and you

262
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,210
have to turn left when you thought you

263
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,100
were going to turn right and I would say

264
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,500
that would be the example that I'm going

265
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,350
to use from last evening we had checked

266
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:29,880
into a hotel and you know the room was

267
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:31,920
clean and so it appeared to be fine so

268
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,920
you know we gave it the all-clear we

269
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,960
prayed over the room ask God to cleanse

270
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,740
the room and to fill it with his

271
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:45,450
presence as we've been doing every at

272
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:48,570
every hotel that we come to and we left

273
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,220
and went for supper and then needed to

274
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,920
come back to the room because we decided

275
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,270
we should fill up with gas so that we

276
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,180
wouldn't need to do that today because

277
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:00,930
today's Sunday and we came back to the

278
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:04,560
room and there was a very very strong

279
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:07,500
smell of cigarette smoke nice and I said

280
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,930
oh maybe somebody's post Woking next

281
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,200
door right right or outside and so Jane

282
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,990
opens the door and she goes outside and

283
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,300
there's no one there nope

284
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:21,260
and then yeah and what did you say like

285
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,560
you said well maybe I said I said you

286
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,839
know this smell wasn't here before

287
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,750
so maybe this isn't the room that God

288
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,540
wants us to be in yeah and so we

289
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,520
actually left we went and got gas we

290
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,180
came back and both of us walked in and

291
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,060
we're like it is stronger now and there

292
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,430
wasn't anybody around but there was this

293
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,800
distinct smell of cigarette smoke and

294
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,899
and Jane had already said Oh like is

295
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,339
already giving me a headache and we're

296
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,490
thinking how does this even happen like

297
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:56,480
this was a perfectly fine room right and

298
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:58,370
so we just went down and we asked for a

299
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,450
new room we explained the situation they

300
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,870
were very understanding which is

301
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:06,440
wonderful but as we went up to the other

302
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:09,640
room like we had that conversation of

303
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:13,580
what is God protecting this problem and

304
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:16,100
it reminds me of garth brooks song I'm

305
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,100
not in unanswered prayers like sometimes

306
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,470
we don't know what God is protecting us

307
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,860
from because he has chosen for whatever

308
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:28,370
reason not to tell us right and another

309
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:31,190
example is okay we're in the USA on this

310
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,440
road trip football is really big in the

311
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,110
States like high school football college

312
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,450
football like NFL like that's a national

313
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,860
football football league and so one of

314
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,270
our things was what we should be going

315
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,990
to see a football game because it's so

316
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:48,350
big and like every single town that we

317
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,600
checked in that like nothing was playing

318
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,930
and we're like this is weird like

319
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,050
nothing and it's like it is the season

320
00:14:53,930 --> 00:15:00,920
of football and we're sure it just went

321
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:03,529
well maybe God has a different plan for

322
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,750
us and and what's interesting is we did

323
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,130
check into one hotel and he said well

324
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,930
we're running behind because it was a

325
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,980
big football day yesterday and so we

326
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,050
were packed fall and and

327
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,270
and we recognize that sometimes parties

328
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,100
can get out of hand and is that

329
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,110
something that God just didn't want us

330
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,940
to be a part of or maybe he wanted us to

331
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,850
save our money and put it towards

332
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:27,270
something else like we don't really know

333
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,370
and the human side of us says but tell

334
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:34,170
me right I want to know what you've

335
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:35,940
protected me from the God side is no I

336
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,390
want you to trust me right

337
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:42,990
and and I guess like even you know when

338
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:47,580
we think about the room from last

339
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:49,290
evening did he want us in both rooms he

340
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,030
may have wanted us to pray over both

341
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:57,000
rooms because we prayed over both rooms

342
00:15:51,030 --> 00:16:00,570
so and I'm reminded of how he said to

343
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,700
Joshua before he before Joshua took the

344
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,890
Israelites into Canaan he said to Joshua

345
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,120
every place you put your feet I will

346
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,180
give you it will be yours

347
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,630
so was that we don't know the answer I'm

348
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,240
just making these broad statements but

349
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,400
it's possible God wanted us in both

350
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,230
rooms I don't know I don't know what may

351
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,150
yet happen or what would have happened

352
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,580
or could have happened that he needed

353
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,260
one of his children to be in that room

354
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,330
so that they could pray over it so his

355
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,190
presence could hover there we don't know

356
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,230
the answer to that so it could have been

357
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:35,400
to protect us it could have been because

358
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:38,220
he wanted us to be in both rooms but it

359
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,920
was very clear that he did not want to

360
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,710
squanto's in that first room and we were

361
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,530
to move and so we were obedient and we

362
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,180
moved and as Jen says we may never know

363
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:52,410
the answer to that and that's okay

364
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:54,870
because God is God and we are not and

365
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:58,170
and that's just it like when when God

366
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:00,180
speaks to us because He loves us he has

367
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,780
a plan and purpose for our life he uses

368
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,730
signs looking at the circumstances in

369
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,620
our life like well why didn't that

370
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,530
person return that email I needed it now

371
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,750
I'm well there you know maybe if you had

372
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,650
gotten that answer when you thought you

373
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,000
needed it

374
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,640
then you actually would have made

375
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,040
certain decisions that are not gone

376
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,949
honoring and so by you waiting then

377
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:27,360
other circumstances change and actually

378
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:29,190
that's the best timing but also that's

379
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,750
there's the waiting side of this why

380
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,240
didn't this work out but the flip side

381
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:37,620
is that sometimes that God does give us

382
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:40,380
signs and we ignore them so you know the

383
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,790
the traffic jam goes two ways like maybe

384
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,020
you're in the traffic jam because God is

385
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,270
protecting you from something greater

386
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,890
and wants a certain timing thing or

387
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,140
sometimes the Lord did tap you on the

388
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,390
shoulder and say no don't I know you

389
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,120
take the expressway every day I know you

390
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,010
take but I want you to go on this road

391
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,460
and you're like but that's gonna take me

392
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:01,890
17 minutes longer I'm not going that way

393
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,510
or you just and that's where the spirit

394
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,030
just sort of drops the idea in your head

395
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,540
and you're like and you sort of brush it

396
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,040
away

397
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,540
rather than following through and so

398
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,440
then you get on the expressway and

399
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:16,530
you're like oh this is why this is that

400
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,790
idea was dropped into my head and so

401
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:24,390
part of this whole I want to say first

402
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,520
first in our series on signs is to

403
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,380
cultivate that spirit within you though

404
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,090
that when you accept Christ into your

405
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,309
heart you're told who the Holy Spirit

406
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:36,530
comes and lives

407
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,330
basically to make us into the person

408
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,070
that God created us to be that whole

409
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,360
idea of helping us to fulfill the plans

410
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:47,480
and purposes that Christ has for us and

411
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,220
so the Holy Spirit you know speaks to us

412
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,950
through the Word of God through prayer

413
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,710
through circumstances through people

414
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,360
through dreams and visions and our job

415
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,929
is actually then to say dear Lord Jesus

416
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,299
would you help me to see the signs as we

417
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:04,730
prayed that day like help us to see the

418
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:07,820
signs help us to be aware and help us

419
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,470
not to be closed off to what other

420
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,559
people might be speaking into our lives

421
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,360
and sometimes it's you know this I want

422
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:19,700
to say the strangest people can speak

423
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:21,710
truth into our life and an example is I

424
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,970
was planning on going to specific city

425
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,919
in the US and my friend Jared who was on

426
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,600
the show a couple years ago he said oh

427
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,299
like you need to be really careful about

428
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,220
going to that City and I'm like okay and

429
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:36,200
then I was talking with another

430
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,179
gentleman from our church who was a

431
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,679
truck driver at one point in time and

432
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,510
when I said ongoing planning and going

433
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,549
to see I'm going to see a hockey game in

434
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,630
the city he was like oh you need to be

435
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,630
really careful about that city

436
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:50,150
especially at night and I'm like okay

437
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:53,960
and then we were at a Jeremy camp

438
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,460
concert total like two random couples

439
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,280
sat behind us where I guess we sat in

440
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,380
front of them and they said when we said

441
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,419
we're going to go I'm gonna go to st.

442
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:06,020
Louis and like oh that's that's not safe

443
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:08,330
and like a chain at that point said Jen

444
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,799
that's three witnesses that's three

445
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,260
different people and none of them know

446
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:14,419
each other all have spoken to say really

447
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,910
that's not the safest city and so I you

448
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,900
know I take that and I say to the Lord

449
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,309
what what do you want me to do with this

450
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,260
and so as a result I planning a

451
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:23,630
different route home because

452
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:28,340
that that's a witness that's a sign that

453
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:30,260
I need to take seriously and so as we as

454
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,500
we close off the show today I want you

455
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:36,950
to think about like how has God spoken

456
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,690
to me what are the signs that I have

457
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,510
known very clearly that God has spoken

458
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,640
to me or that maybe I think God might be

459
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,830
speaking to me

460
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,960
Ouisa we would say ask the Lord just

461
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,220
what do I do with this maybe it's a

462
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,780
verse or scripture and you're like is

463
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,800
this for me well asked the Lord Lord am

464
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,870
I supposed to do something about this

465
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,450
verse or I feel like you spoke that to

466
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,580
me would you would you confirm that in

467
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,870
someone else or maybe it's a friend that

468
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,260
is saying something to you

469
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:05,240
could you confirm that sign because I

470
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,240
want to walk in the fullness of your

471
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,340
plans and purposes for my life so as we

472
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,940
as we close off we're gonna pray for you

473
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,130
and ask God to guide and direct you and

474
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,110
to give you an open heart to receive

475
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,660
that so let's pray dear Lord Jesus thank

476
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,670
you so much for today thank you that

477
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,290
Lord you have plans and purposes for our

478
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,690
life and you do speak to us and you

479
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,220
speak to us through a variety of means

480
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:33,650
that mean we call signs whether it's

481
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:35,270
Scripture or spirit or prayer lord help

482
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,280
us to be sensitive to the leading of

483
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,680
your Holy Spirit today that we would

484
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,940
walk where you want us to walk and speak

485
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,980
what you would have us to speak and

486
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,810
drive where you would want to strive so

487
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,550
we can experience the full life that you

488
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,550
have for us and we ask this

489
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:55,600
