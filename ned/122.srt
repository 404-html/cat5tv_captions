Jen. And on today's show we're

4
00:00:05,99 --> 00:00:06,599
going to talk about a man named

5
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,939
Phil.. So stay tuned. We will be

6
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,900
right back. This is new every day

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:35,100
with Jim Bakker. And Carrie. Hey

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,79
everyone thank you for tuning in

9
00:00:37,79 --> 00:00:38,700
again to news every day. We're

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,899
so glad that you've tuned in. And

11
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,609
maybe this is your first time joining

12
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,729
us. And John and I have been friends

13
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:46,890
for a number of years. We sit down

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,869
here and we record this show and

15
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:50,969
just talk about life stuff we talk

16
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,469
about God we talk about the Bible

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,670
we talk about how it applies to

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,530
our lives. We talk about Jesus

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,350
and what he has actually done and

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,179
changed our lives and given us

21
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,250
a new perspective. And so we just

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,509
kind of engage in conversation

23
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:05,170
and pull you in along with us.

24
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,620
So thanks for tuning in. So we've

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,189
talked about the book of Acts Jan

26
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,579
and then we've kind of strayed

27
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,409
off a little bit and now we're

28
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,150
headed back. And what are we going

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,620
to talk about today. Well today

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,359
we're actually backtracking because

31
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,799
the last time we talked about the

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,150
book back we talked about Saul's

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,269
conversion and as we thought OK

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,930
we need to get back into the into

35
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,290
the book of Acts where are we going.

36
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,329
And we're like well we're going

37
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:28,790
for after Saul's conversion and

38
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:32,370
when we said wait a second we skipped

39
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,379
over a man named Phil and for some

40
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,879
of the way you might be thinking

41
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:39,299
will do.And what's interesting

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,400
is that the author of The Book

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,799
of Acts who is the doctor Luke.

44
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,579
Actually gives. Almost a full chapter

45
00:01:48,60 --> 00:01:50,590
to a man named Phil or Philip.

46
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:52,230
And you might be thinking Well

47
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:59,819
who is what he is. Phil OK. So

48
00:02:00,0 --> 00:02:01,530
according to the commentary it

49
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,180
says he is one of the seven chosen

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,99
to oversee the ministry of distribution

51
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,290
distributing aid to the needy in

52
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,840
Jerusalem church. Now he has become

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,189
an evangelist spreading the Good

54
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,500
News about Jesus. He wasn't one

55
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,39
of the 12 disciples. But and we've

56
00:02:17,39 --> 00:02:19,500
talked about this in previous shows.

57
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,50
Basically the ministry was getting

58
00:02:22,50 --> 00:02:24,960
so large that the Apostles could

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,780
no longer give attention to just

60
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,0
preaching and praying the gospel.

61
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,870
And so they were through the power

62
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,39
of the Holy Spirit. They were told

63
00:02:35,39 --> 00:02:37,409
to set aside a number of men to

64
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,180
look after the waiting tables that

65
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,159
means the care of the church. And

66
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,819
so we talked about Stephen a little

67
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,530
while ago and how he was one of

68
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,80
those seven. And so Philip was

69
00:02:49,80 --> 00:02:51,840
one of those seven two. And Chapter

70
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,909
8 the story as you say the story

71
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,849
of Stephen ends at the beginning

72
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,270
in verse 8. This is on that day

73
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,310
a great persecution broke out against

74
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,259
the church at Jerusalem and all

75
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,849
except the Apostles were scattered

76
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,80
through the Judea and Samaria.

77
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,569
So that's all. So the only ones

78
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,120
that remained in Jerusalem were

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,419
the Apostles godly men buried Stephen

80
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,159
and more deeply for him but Saul

81
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,659
began to destroy the church going

82
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,310
from house to house.He dragged

83
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,389
off men and women and put them

84
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,770
in prison and then we went on to

85
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,379
talk about Saul's conversion. Now

86
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,389
coming up to verse 4 is this man

87
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,639
named Philip who we you know we

88
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,500
first saw back in chapter. Well

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,139
let's just see. We saw him around

90
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,849
chapter three when they actually

91
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,650
laid their hands on people and

92
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,110
they actually listed off the number

93
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,300
of people the names of the people

94
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,659
of who would participate in this

95
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,439
ministry. And and Philip's name

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,30
was mentioned around those seven.

97
00:04:01,20 --> 00:04:04,139
So here we go verse 4 starts off

98
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,300
like this. Those who had been scattered

99
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,39
preached the word wherever they

100
00:04:08,39 --> 00:04:10,830
went. Philip went down to the city

101
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,530
of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ

102
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,230
there when the crowds heard Philip

103
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,209
and saw the miraculous signs he

104
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,519
did. They all paid close attention

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,709
to what he did with shrieks. Evil

106
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,750
spirits came out of many and many

107
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,149
paralytics and cripple's were healed.

108
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:29,459
So there was a great joy in that

109
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:33,89
city. I just I love the fact. Of

110
00:04:33,89 --> 00:04:35,129
this passage but as I read that

111
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:37,949
what caught my eye was so those

112
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,89
that have been scattered preached

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,480
the word wherever they went. Like

114
00:04:42,89 --> 00:04:44,879
even though they were scattered

115
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:47,670
because of persecution. It's not

116
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,360
like they said okay. To lay low

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,339
for a bit. Got to lay low let this

118
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:56,250
thing pass over or I can't talk

119
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:57,600
to Jesus he's going to get me killed.

120
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,0
And what's interesting is that as

121
00:05:00,0 --> 00:05:03,0
one of the apologetics or arguments

122
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,209
that they that Christian I want

123
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,819
to say speakers are often used

124
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,180
when they say well we know Jesus

125
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,149
actually rose from the dead because

126
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:14,129
his apostles and those who saw

127
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:17,850
him proclaimed him because why

128
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,560
would you be willing to die for

129
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,19
someone or something if it wasn't

130
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,430
real that you didn't believe in

131
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,430
your Noer that it was real. And

132
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,769
so like Philip Here's Philip after

133
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:30,660
having been scattered from Jerusalem

134
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,360
continues to preach the Word of

135
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,100
God of the Christ. That's what

136
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,19
it says. It says the Christ or

137
00:05:37,19 --> 00:05:39,209
the Messiah. So he was claiming

138
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,980
that Jesus is the Son of God. It

139
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,29
didn't matter that he had been

140
00:05:42,29 --> 00:05:43,259
scattered it didn't matter that

141
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,420
Steve and his friends had been

142
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,519
killed. He was willing to lay down

143
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,459
his life for the sake of the gospel.

144
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,620
Like now it says to me that's real.

145
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,480
This is real and what I also respect

146
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,370
about the apostles here and about

147
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,610
the bonus ones like Philip is that

148
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,290
even though Stephen was just killed

149
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,870
like the Lord used that for his

150
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,399
purposes because in scattering

151
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,810
then the word was spread and we

152
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,310
talked about that when we spoke

153
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,730
about Stephen but they didn't sit

154
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,180
in mourning. They realized the

155
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,689
value and be had the eternal perspective

156
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:23,790
of the kingdom of God. This is

157
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,160
not all that there is. Yes. And

158
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,350
if you feel if you think that way

159
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,149
that this is it that this is all

160
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,540
that there is to life then.It influences

161
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,730
how you respond to tragedy and

162
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,410
how you respond to persecution

163
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,170
and people commenting or you know

164
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:43,649
saying harmful things to you then

165
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:45,629
it's much easier to internalize

166
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:47,370
it because you don't have an eternal

167
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,230
perspective. But it's like these

168
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,910
guys knew where the game was at.

169
00:06:51,89 --> 00:06:53,69
Yes. Like you're going to run hard

170
00:06:53,69 --> 00:06:55,319
until you finish and Stephen finished

171
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,420
seemingly early. Yeah but it was

172
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,829
just the start of their ministry

173
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:00,959
going forward and you know as you

174
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,60
were you were saying this is so

175
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,0
easy when the hard knocks come

176
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,620
when the challenges of life come

177
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,89
just like you said. I'm going to

178
00:07:09,89 --> 00:07:11,310
lay low. I'm going to lay low low

179
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,509
I'm just going to take it easy.

180
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,310
And as you were speaking you really

181
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,250
how is speaking to my spirit. My

182
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,720
sister passed away almost a year

183
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,449
ago now. And you know it would

184
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,29
have been easy at that point in

185
00:07:24,29 --> 00:07:25,620
time just you know oh this is so

186
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,860
sad. And yeah I saw it as an opportunity

187
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,139
of proclaiming the good news of

188
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,89
how faithful God was like. Even

189
00:07:33,89 --> 00:07:34,829
though from a very earthly perspective

190
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,379
it you know her life might not

191
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,19
have been seen seemed as successful

192
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,980
or a benefit to those around her.

193
00:07:44,40 --> 00:07:45,779
And yet I know that God used her

194
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,639
to do so much in my life and and

195
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,110
to the people that interacted with

196
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,889
her. So at her funeral I was I

197
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,60
actually had to share the gospel

198
00:07:54,60 --> 00:07:57,360
story of how you know I don't understand

199
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,699
why all this is happening and and

200
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,370
here's Philip who's thinking Oh

201
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,839
he's the Messiah.He came to the

202
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,279
Jewish people why are these people

203
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,990
rising up like he very well could

204
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,720
have been like was what makes this

205
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,100
doesn't make sense. But he said

206
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:14,639
no. I know who Jesus is. I. Am

207
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,709
going to proclaim him and I am

208
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,990
going to continue to go out. And

209
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,269
it was just you know a real opportunity

210
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,100
for me to share. Like I don't understand

211
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,870
what's happening. But I do believe

212
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,0
in a God who is faithful. I do

213
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:29,160
believe that Jesus really did die

214
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,110
on the cross for our sins so that

215
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,240
at the end of time at the end of

216
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,90
our stories here on Earth that

217
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,49
were going to be you know renewed

218
00:08:37,49 --> 00:08:38,809
with him and like Face-To-Face

219
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,529
glory. And my sister is going to

220
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:41,820
have a new body and I'm going to

221
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,440
get to see her again because those

222
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,850
who have faith in Jesus Christ

223
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,399
will be reunited. Yes. And it's

224
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,809
just that's part of the like the

225
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,139
yes story. Yeah. And that's what

226
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:53,399
Peter Philip is proclaiming. He's

227
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,610
proclaiming that yes yes like this

228
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,940
is who Jesus is. And what's interesting

229
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,539
is that part of to be a group part

230
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,590
of the Group of Seven they had

231
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,799
to have be like godly men and full

232
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,259
of the Spirit and had you know

233
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,720
been a part of that group who followed

234
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,870
Jesus. So I just I love the fact

235
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,230
that it said Philip went down even

236
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,129
though they had been scattered

237
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,269
they preach wherever they went.

238
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:26,399
So he went down to the city of Samaria

239
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,769
which was a big no no for Jewish

240
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,289
people Big no no. We saw that in

241
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:33,679
John Chapter Four when Jewish stuff.

242
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,960
Jesus he was Jewish. Jesus stopped

243
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,70
at the well and was speaking to

244
00:09:38,70 --> 00:09:40,350
the Samaritan woman and everyone

245
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,840
was that one he was speaking to

246
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,149
a woman in that time that was a

247
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:46,70
no no. And she was a Samaritan

248
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,840
which was also the Jews did not

249
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,9
associate with Samaritans So it's

250
00:09:49,9 --> 00:09:50,299
very interesting that that's where

251
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,759
he goes. Yeah it is. And it goes

252
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,279
on when the crowd heard fill up.

253
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:58,129
So he's preaching and then saw

254
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,169
the miraculous signs that he did.

255
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,870
They all paid close attention to

256
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,330
what he said and was shrieks. Evil

257
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,950
spirits came out of many and many

258
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,509
paralytics and cripple's were healed.

259
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,690
So there is great joy in that city.

260
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:14,330
So as we go to commercial break

261
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,529
what I want you to think about

262
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,80
what part of the gospel message

263
00:10:18,80 --> 00:10:21,120
brings you great joy. That. Right

Ferguson who hopes to produce this

291
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:26,440
program. So we're back with a man

292
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,899
named Phil Phil. I know it's it's

293
00:11:29,9 --> 00:11:30,629
it's early. What I love is that

294
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,139
it's there's one chapter in the

295
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,340
book of Acts. You know he doesn't

296
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,899
have a book named act he didn't

297
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,809
write a book. Yeah. I don't actually

298
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:39,940
think he's mentioned in any of

299
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,169
the other. Like many of the other

300
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:43,870
writers write about Phil. And so

301
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,19
what was it about his life. That.

302
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,19
That Luke wanted us to hear. I

303
00:11:50,19 --> 00:11:51,879
think it's just this. He was a

304
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,129
man who loved Jesus who was part

305
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,779
of that group of seven who were

306
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,940
set apart by the Apostles who when

307
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,740
persecution came he just kept going.

308
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,519
He just kept going. And that's

309
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,259
an aspect of his story that I hadn't

310
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:08,19
thought about before. And I wonder

311
00:12:08,19 --> 00:12:09,840
when he was actually murdered I

312
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,289
would have to look that up I for

313
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:14,169
next show.Maybe that's why he's

314
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,669
not mentioned later on. I don't

315
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,590
know. But it's that tenacity in

316
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,269
that kingdom perspective. Yes.

317
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,340
That this isn't what life is about

318
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,139
is knowing Christ knowing that

319
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,759
we're loved by him that he was

320
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,990
risen from the dead and that this

321
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,70
stuff is real. Yeah. Motivated

322
00:12:28,90 --> 00:12:29,529
his actions. Well because it says

323
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,0
they all paid close attention to

324
00:12:31,0 --> 00:12:33,309
what he said. Why. Because he spoke

325
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,70
and then the miraculous signs happened.

326
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,39
So I don't think he's like Ben.

327
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,259
I think it's like oh you're sick

328
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,59
in the name of Jesus be healed.

329
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:44,919
Right. So he was aware of what

330
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,49
was going on. He saw the need and

331
00:12:47,49 --> 00:12:48,700
he prayed because he believed.

332
00:12:49,59 --> 00:12:50,409
And so they're watching him they're

333
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:53,590
watching him just be a real believer

334
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,299
in Christ. Yes like like this is

335
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,500
and I know a lot of churches and

336
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,80
I know I've spoken with other people

337
00:13:02,80 --> 00:13:04,149
who say that they're Christians

338
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,610
and say that the Book of Acts is

339
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,490
not for today that the signs and

340
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,950
wonders done like the healing in

341
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,690
the casting out of evil spirits.

342
00:13:14,49 --> 00:13:15,399
That was for that time and it's

343
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,9
not for today. But I got to believe

344
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,320
that this is for today because

345
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,149
Jesus commissioned them to go out

346
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,980
and this this whole movement was

347
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,720
just to continue continue continue

348
00:13:26,19 --> 00:13:28,210
because Jesus prayed when he was

349
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,409
in the garden or when he was with

350
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,789
his disciples the night before

351
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:36,279
he died he prayed for the people

352
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,809
who are going to come to know him

353
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:40,120
through the apostles he was praying

354
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,940
for us.I think to live this way

355
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,409
to have the fullness of the knowledge

356
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:47,860
of God and The word also says that

357
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,809
the signs will follow those that

358
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,90
believe the healing of the sick

359
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,940
the raising of the dead. Yes. The

360
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,700
casting out of demons and the lame

361
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,59
walk the blind will see. Jesus

362
00:14:01,59 --> 00:14:02,919
said you see me do these things

363
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,620
and you will too even more. Yes.

364
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,49
And John I've just been challenged

365
00:14:08,49 --> 00:14:12,580
lately just to Pray. Crazy prayers.

366
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,549
Now what I mean by crazy is like

367
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:19,899
believing that God can do miraculous

368
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,799
things and for a people and generation

369
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,820
like in western society where we

370
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,320
rely so much on ourselves or technology

371
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,529
or whatever in our lives I think

372
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,320
that God can speak to people by

373
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,620
doing the miraculous through his

374
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,960
church. And that in the last time

375
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,580
that people will be turned to him

376
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:47,590
because of the signs and wonders

377
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,789
that will follow those that truly

378
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:52,720
believe. And. You know we had a

379
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,39
woman in our church who had hurt

380
00:14:54,39 --> 00:14:55,899
her shoulder and she messaged me

381
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:56,710
saying can you put this on the

382
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,269
perch. And that's what we do. We

383
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,460
have a prayer chain at church basically

384
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,629
sending the email is sending a

385
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,279
text message it goes out to a group

386
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,80
of people they start praying. And

387
00:15:05,80 --> 00:15:07,690
she said to me after that was sent

388
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:09,250
and after I received prayer on

389
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,990
Sunday morning my shoulder felt

390
00:15:11,49 --> 00:15:13,240
miraculously better. Yeah. And

391
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,759
I was just like yeah like and it

392
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,679
shouldn't shock us but sometimes

393
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,870
it does because not always.Do people

394
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,840
share with us how they feel healed

395
00:15:23,70 --> 00:15:25,299
or they are healed after we've

396
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,159
prayed for them. But it was just

397
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,220
like yeah god like why wouldn't

398
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,669
you do this. We asked and we ask

399
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,399
in faith. Yeah. And it was just

400
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,379
so cool. Like when you said this

401
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,389
is for today. This is for. It is

402
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,39
for today. And that question that

403
00:15:45,39 --> 00:15:47,49
I asked before we went to break

404
00:15:47,49 --> 00:15:48,700
said you know so there was great

405
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,80
joy in that city and so what is

406
00:15:50,80 --> 00:15:52,0
it that brings me joy about the

407
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:54,100
gospel. What is it. And it's probably

408
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,740
hearing God stories about how when

409
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,629
people open themselves up to Jesus

410
00:15:59,19 --> 00:16:01,360
being changed by him and and hearing

411
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,250
them just share the stories of

412
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,139
how they are transformed. I used

413
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,879
to do this but now I do this. I

414
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,0
used to do this and now I do this

415
00:16:09,9 --> 00:16:11,440
I used to you know like my marriage

416
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,750
was just falling apart. And then

417
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,240
I came to know Jesus and he healed

418
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,190
like that's probably one of my

419
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,230
greatest joy is just seeing the

420
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,440
power of Jesus Christ working in

421
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,830
the lives of people. Yeah. Like

422
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,620
that's my yay. God yeah. That's

423
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,230
what brings me great joy. When

424
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,120
I think about the Gospel message

425
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:37,389
is just how lives are changed when

426
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:39,620
they meet Jesus. Yeah. And I'm

427
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,80
more and more convinced that he

428
00:16:41,80 --> 00:16:43,450
really is the answer to every problem.

429
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,230
Like there is no problem too big.

430
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:49,659
And it's sometimes like if I pray

431
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:50,740
for someone to be healed and then

432
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,899
I healed. It's easy to think of

433
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,29
all the reasons why and that all

434
00:16:55,29 --> 00:16:56,289
the reasons why not to pray in

435
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,669
the future. But if I'm not praying

436
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,840
that nothing's going to happen.

437
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,49
So why not just pray. I know I

438
00:17:02,49 --> 00:17:04,990
got to share a story so my mom

439
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,279
was at a parent teacher. Night

440
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,79
I guess and the school for my little

441
00:17:11,79 --> 00:17:14,230
brother and the custodian was there

442
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,759
and she was complaining of back

443
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,69
pain. And my mom just went up and

444
00:17:18,69 --> 00:17:20,319
she was like I would pray for you

445
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,539
back. OK. And then she just put

446
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:24,430
her head on her back and prayed

447
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,559
for her that she would be healed

448
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,900
and that was it. And my mom walks

449
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,309
in faith believing that God can

450
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:31,490
do like all these crazy people.

451
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,279
And then he does. And then he died.

452
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,890
Yes. So anyway is the custodian

453
00:17:36,9 --> 00:17:37,690
a couple of days later I spoke

454
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,160
with another teacher at the school

455
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,279
who knows my mom and said. After

456
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,410
that lady pray for me my back gets

457
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,869
Better. Yes right. Yeah. I know.

458
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,279
Lord priest or like I just believe

459
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,839
that he can he can do these things.

460
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,759
We're out of time already. We're

461
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,710
out of time. Read that passage

462
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,710
about Philip. As a. How can I look

463
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,180
like Philip or what part of Philip's

464
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,69
life can I be a part of in the

465
00:18:03,69 --> 00:18:05,49
sense of like maybe you're feeling

466
00:18:05,49 --> 00:18:06,670
opposition but you still need to

467
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,160
step out in faith or maybe God's

468
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,299
call you to pray for someone or

469
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,750
to do a miraculous sign and you're

470
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:12,490
just like whoa that's not for me.

471
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,490
We would say ask the Lord about

472
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,200
that. Like ask him to convict you

473
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,549
to give me the courage that you

474
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,740
need to step out in faith and just

475
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,480
continue to preach you know whatever

476
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,769
the words are that he's given you

477
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,49
to share. So and I just got to

478
00:18:26,49 --> 00:18:30,490
say pray and ask God to show you

479
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,619
something about that person that

480
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:33,910
he would give you even like a word

481
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,769
of knowledge for them something

482
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:36,819
that you could share with them

483
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,79
and pray specifically for them

484
00:18:38,79 --> 00:18:39,819
because he already knows he already

485
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,200
knows them. He already knows them.

486
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,359
So we're going to sign off. May

487
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,849
the Lord. Blow your socks off this

488
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,549
week when you think about what

489
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:49,690
is it that you would have me do

490
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,39
if you asked him that question.

491
00:18:51,69 --> 00:18:54,9
And then just wait. I mean I'm

492
00:18:54,9 --> 00:18:55,150
just thinking that the Lord is

493
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,400
going to have you do step out faith

494
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,440
in a miraculous way. So may you

495
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,740
be strong and courageous knowing

496
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,539
that God is love. So until next
