12
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,329
we're looking at this guy Phil Philip

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,489
Philip we call him Phil I have a friend

14
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,620
named Phil whose great youth pastor and

15
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,129
so actually when I think when I read

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,680
Philip I'm like oh yeah Phil Jesus tells

17
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,180
people about Jesus and yeah actually I

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:06,149
remember hearing a speaker talking about

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:08,700
Paul and how in that time period you

20
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:11,280
know if we like you're Jennifer and I

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,050
call you Jen so we shorten people's name

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,490
as terms of endearment well they

23
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,560
actually kind of lengthened people's

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,369
names Oh as terms of a dip endearment

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,890
like Priscilla instead of prissa oh I

26
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,619
know very interesting so if we like him

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,920
we call him Philip not Phil fella so

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,840
Philip so yes we started off with he's

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,539
one of the seven men that was set apart

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,680
to take care of the tables and then when

31
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:40,289
Stephen was was stoned the persecuted

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,320
church scattered he went to the town of

33
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:43,950
Samaria the towns of Samaria proclaimed

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,469
the gospel

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,490
I'm rate amazing miraculous signs happen

36
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:52,530
a man named Simon who's a sorcerer

37
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,119
believed was baptized was baptized and

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,799
then saw the power of the Holy Spirit

39
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,170
coming through the laying on of hands

40
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,770
like I want to buy that and Peter and

41
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,920
John who showed up they were like and so

42
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,960
we ended off last week with the question

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,780
of okay we don't think they dropped

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,140
Simon but maybe someone came alongside

45
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,720
Simon and mentored him walked and

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,880
alongside him and discipled him so here

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,489
we are back focusing in on Philip and

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,049
the Ethiopian and Phil is just walking

49
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,060
along and he just listens to God and I

50
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:27,840
really like this so can you read it Jen

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:31,140
yes so start at verse 26 now an angel of

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,620
the Lord said to Philip go go sev to the

53
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,900
road the river the desert road that goes

54
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,700
down from Jerusalem to Gaza so he

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,040
started out and on his way he met an

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,109
Ethiopian eunuch an important official

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,570
in charge of all the Treasury of Candace

58
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:46,980
queen of the Ethiopians this man had

59
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,840
gone to Jerusalem to worship

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,370
and on his way home was sitting in his

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,610
chariot reading the book of Isaiah the

62
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,560
prophet the spirit told Philip go to

63
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,540
that chariot and stay near it

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,220
then Philip ran up to the chariot and

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,110
heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet

66
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,900
do you understand what you're reading

67
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,450
Philip asked how can I he said unless

68
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,250
someone explains it to me so he invited

69
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,750
Philip to come up and sit with him the

70
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,790
eunuch was reading this passage of

71
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,709
Scripture he was led like a sheep to the

72
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,930
slaughter and as a lamb before the

73
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,510
Shearer is silent so he did not open his

74
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,519
mouth in his humiliation he was deprived

75
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,290
of justice who can speak of his

76
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,319
descendants for his life was taken from

77
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,329
the earth the eunuch asked Philip tell

78
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,310
me please who is the prophet talking

79
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,010
about himself or someone else then

80
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,299
Philip began with that very passage of

81
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,819
Scripture and told him the good news

82
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,379
about Jesus as they travel along the

83
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,930
road they came to some water and the

84
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,700
eunuch said look here's the water why

85
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,190
shouldn't I be baptized and he gave

86
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,230
orders to stop the chariot then both

87
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,420
Philip and the eunuch went down into the

88
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,190
water and Philip baptized him when they

89
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,750
came up out of the water the Spirit of

90
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,459
the Lord suddenly took Philip away and

91
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,099
the eunuch did not see him again but

92
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,859
went on his way rejoicing Philip however

93
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,410
appeared at as as itas and traveled

94
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,870
about preaching the gospel in the towns

95
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,200
until he reached says RIA and that is

96
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,799
the last we hear about Philip it's

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,260
amazing it's an amazing story yeah and I

98
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,419
think even from you know two episodes

99
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,950
ago when we're when we were first

100
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:21,299
introduced to Philip at least in this

101
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:22,889
section yeah he was scattered but he

102
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,560
just preached wherever he went just

103
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,330
preached were like yeah it picks it up

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,729
again right now the angel of Lord told

105
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,970
Philip to go somewhere and so he went

106
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,690
yeah and then it ends again with right

107
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,530
afterwards

108
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,530
Philip however basically the Spirit of

109
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,840
the Lord took them away and wherever

110
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,190
what does that even feel like I don't

111
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,599
know but I've always wanted to fly my

112
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:50,070
whole life I've always wanted to fly and

113
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:52,020
is that like a transponder a trans you

114
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,289
know like like in Star Trek when they

115
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,900
yes the twirly sparkle come yes did the

116
00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:00,300
Lord truly Sparkle I don't know but this

117
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,240
is where it like literally the Spirit

118
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,449
suddenly took Philip away and then

119
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,970
planted him down I know I know but this

120
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,690
is the nature of the kingdom of God like

121
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:15,900
I legit believe it so do i and then part

122
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,909
of me wants to say do it to me what does

123
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,520
that look like and the interesting part

124
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,590
is I have heard of things like this not

125
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,330
in the North American context but in an

126
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,120
African context right

127
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,849
we're friend a friend of mine was

128
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:35,389
praying in his community and literally

129
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:38,460
saw someone fall out of the sky I know I

130
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,590
know I like I believe him because he

131
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:45,060
doesn't make things up so I know it can

132
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:48,960
happen yeah and I like I I read this and

133
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:51,509
I'm like all Philip did was preach the

134
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,889
gospel because did you notice how he

135
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:55,020
didn't stay to the disciple of the

136
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,479
eunuch no he was just like bam bam

137
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,539
scattering the seeds gathering the seem

138
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,940
the lord aizen people done and he's not

139
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,919
the one that's saying he's done the Lord

140
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,990
is the one who's saying he's done he's

141
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,979
not like okay this looks like a good

142
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:13,319
place to stay because it says after last

143
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:16,979
week's passage now the angel of the Lord

144
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,380
said go so he went so true so after in

145
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,960
this story with the Ethiopian the angel

146
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,960
of the Lord again picked him up and took

147
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,020
him off right the spirit of Lord so it's

148
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,020
like he was fully surrendered to go and

149
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,060
do whatever it was that the Lord wanted

150
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,800
him to go and do and it was just to

151
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,139
preach the gospel and people came to

152
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,020
know him and Dan came to know Jesus and

153
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,129
then he baptized it in like let me don't

154
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,750
know what happened after that so we

155
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:45,810
don't know if he was finished or if he

156
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,300
was put down somewhere else if this was

157
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,919
just a story to say this is like the

158
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,560
power of what happens when people are

159
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,710
fully surrendered to God yeah like I'm

160
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,840
just like I want to I want to be an

161
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,599
opportunistic Christian like when I

162
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,870
think about an opportunistic feeder or

163
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,099
like a bird of prey yeah like if there's

164
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,539
already something going on they'll just

165
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,370
go and like join in they'll eat

166

whatever's there you know but I want to

167
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,000
be that in the sense that if something

168
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:14,610
comes up I'm just ready to go that way

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,169
yeah if God's like go jump in that chair

170
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,330
I'll be like okay you know go jump like

171
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,759
go over on the long side I'd have to

172
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:28,889
carry it okay so go something in good

173
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,139
shape it's going flow but anyways what

174
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:35,039
ok wait yes I know you go ahead ok ma'am

175
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:38,699
I like it Phillip ran to him and heard

176
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:42,210
him reading the prophet Isaiah mm-hmm so

177
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:45,240
like who was this guy why was he going

178
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,710
to Jerusalem I remember learning about

179
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,139
this one time and I can't remember the

180
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:53,490
exact details um but anyways what I also

181
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,469
appreciate is that Phillip was just

182
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,319
ready to engage him he didn't need the

183
00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:00,300
whole plan spelled out for him from the

184
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,710
spirit but just not like I need to go

185
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,069
there and God's gonna take care of the

186
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,340
rest

187
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:07,169
yeah it was like there was nothing like

188
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,779
you're gonna work with chariot then

189
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,370
you're going to say a B and C and then

190
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,080
you're gonna step in and then it's gonna

191
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,949
be amazing you're gonna baptize him he

192
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,740
didn't have a plan

193
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:19,319
he was just like go run beside the

194
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,210
chariot and then you're just trying to

195
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,250
tell him the truth I know cuz he like

196
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,370
the question he asked was well do you

197
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,620
understand what you're eating like

198
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,020
you're right yeah like and it just

199
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,560
allowed the conversation to go from

200
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,760
there

201
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,490
yeah and tell me please who is the

202
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,039
Prophet you know and it was just so

203
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,750
powerful that Philip took that off the

204
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,269
opportunity that was presented in front

205
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,800
of him by the Holy Spirit right that's

206
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,320
the important part it was presented to

207
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,300
him by the Holy Spirit and then the Holy

208
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,230
Spirit just gave him everything that he

209
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,930
needed yeah

210
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,000
and that backs up those passages in the

211
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,560
Gospels verses don't worry about what

212
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,640
you're going to say when you're walking

213
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,980
with the Lord

214
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,199
he's like take care of him he's gonna

215
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,839
take care of it and you and I also

216
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:09,480
appreciate that ok the angel the Lord

217
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,910
said go here but the disciples or the

218
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,290
Apostles also like they would start

219
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,029
going somewhere and then Holy Spirit

220
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,930
would be like nope not here they'd go

221
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,760
somewhere else when you'd be like it

222
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,649
over here but they still went and did

223
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,320
stuff yes and people some people say oh

224
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:24,390
I'm just waiting to be led but if you

225
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,550
don't just go out and start running

226
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:30,550
beside chariots don't run with traffic I

227
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,100
that's a bad idea but hit on that then

228
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,450
the opportunity might not come so let's

229
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,580

making this show possible gen we're

251
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:36,399
talking with Philip I know he's running

252
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,790
along beside the chariot and the

253
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,820
Ethiopian eunuch invites him in and he's

254
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,620
reading Isaiah in his Isaiah 53 and he

255
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,630
says he was led as a sheep to the

256
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,700
slaughter and has a lamb before it's

257
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,120
Shearer is silent so he opened not his

258
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,820
mouth

259
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,190
in his humiliation his justice was taken

260
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,470
away and who will declare his digit

261
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,440
generation for his life is taken from

262
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,240
the earth and the eunuchs like who who

263
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,970
is the prophet talking about himself or

264
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,649
someone else and then it says then

265
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,690
Philip opened his mouth and beginning

266
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,930
with this scripture preached Jesus to

267
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,240
him so he's using the Old Testament and

268
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:15,820
Isaiah 53 is just like this remarkable

269
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,190
remarkable chapter about Jesus written

270
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,980
700 years before Jesus came and I know

271
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,380
we've talked about on this show before

272
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,260
but it's so remarkable so push pause

273
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,350
right now go get your Bible and open up

274
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:32,560
Isaiah 53 with us so you can see it for

275
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:36,010
yourself and let let God speak to you

276
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,779
through this incredible Scripture do you

277
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,310
have it there I do all right

278
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:41,170
you want to start reading some of that

279
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,779
sure so actually starts the beginning of

280
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,209
or the end of 52 in chapter and verse 13

281
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,740
see my servant will act wisely he will

282
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:49,600
be raised and lifted up in highly

283
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,009
exalted just as there were many who are

284
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,560
appalled at him his appearance was so

285
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:55,959
disfigured beyond that of any man and

286
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,540
his form marred beyond human likeness so

287
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,850
will he sprinkle many nations and Kings

288
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,499
will shut their mouths because of him

289
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,999
for what they were not told they will

290
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:06,189
see and what they have not heard they

291
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:09,339
will understand who has believed our

292
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:11,949
message and who has an and and to whom

293
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,449
has the arm of the Lord been revealed he

294
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:16,720
grew up before him like a tender shoot

295
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:18,879
and like a root out of dry ground

296
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,740
he had no beauty or Majesty to attract

297
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,319
us to him nothing in his appearance that

298
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,240
we should desire him he was despised and

299
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:28,209
rejected by men a man of sorrows and

300
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,189
familiar with suffering no one with whom

301
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,259
men hide their face like like one with

302
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:34,300
from whom men hide their faces he was

303
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:36,550
despised and we esteemed him not

304
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,379
surely he took up our infirmities and

305
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,600
carried our sorrows yet we considered

306
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:42,610
him stricken by God smitten by him and

307
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,350
afflicted but he was pierced for our

308
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,089
transgressions he was crushed for our

309
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,300
iniquities and punishment that brought

310
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:51,160
us peace was upon him for by his wounds

311
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,769
we are healed we all like sheep have

312
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,959
gone astray each of us has turned to his

313
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:58,689
own way and the Lord has laid on him the

314
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,490
iniquity of us all he was oppressed and

315
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:02,680
afflicted yet he did not open his mouth

316
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,420
he was led like a lamb to the slaughter

317
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,899
and a sheep before his Shearer's is

318
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,029
silent so he did not open his mouth by

319
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:12,459
oppression the judgment he had was taken

320
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,990
away and who can speak of his

321
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,189
descendants for he was cut off in the

322
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,160
land of the living for the transgression

323
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:19,660
of my people he was stricken he was

324
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,699
assigned a grave with the wicked and

325
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,679
with the rich in his death though he had

326
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,639
done no violence nor was there any

327
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,889
deceit in his mouth

328
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,779
yet it was the Lord's will to crush him

329
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,939
and cause him to suffer and though the

330
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,860
Lord makes his life a guilt offering he

331
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:34,779
will see his offspring and prolong his

332
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,120
days and the will of the Lord will

333
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:39,040
prosper in his hand after the suffering

334
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,379
of a soul he will see the light of life

335
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,990
and be satisfied by his knowledge my

336
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:45,069
righteous servant will justify many he

337
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,629
will bear their iniquities

338
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:48,250
therefore I will give him a portion

339
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:50,290
among the Great and he will divide the

340
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,800
spoils with the strong because he poured

341
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,140
out his life unto death

342
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,790
and was numbered with the transgressors

343
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,459
for he bore the sin of many and made

344
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:02,290
intercession for the transgressors and

345
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:06,380
so beginning with that scripture Philip

346
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:12,050
told him about Jesus and the good news

347
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:15,380
about him and if he's familiar with

348
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:19,579
Jewish culture and the Passover and what

349
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,220
the why the Jews sacrificed a lamb so

350
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:24,010
that in the Old Testament the book of

351
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,740
Exodus so that the Angel of Death passed

352
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:30,350
over the Israelites when they were in

353
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,329
slavery in Egypt they were saved from

354
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,399
death because they sacrificed the lamb

355
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,620
and put the blood over the doorpost and

356
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,209
that seen them that's that's part of the

357
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,820
Passover story and I encourage you to go

358
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:44,930
look that up in Exodus but it's saying

359
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:47,600
here that Jesus took on our sin he took

360
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:54,260
on our grief he took on our sorrows and

361
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:57,380
he was slain and and by His stripes we

362
00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:00,709
are healed and it's just amazing cuz

363
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,529
each verse in this book in this chapter

364
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:06,500
it prophesized and speaks about the Lord

365
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:09,020
Jesus no even though it's isaiah 700

366
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,380
years before and so when when the eunuch

367
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,940
is hearing this look yes your slaughter

368
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,920
and love why should i be baptized it's

369
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,300
like this is what i believe yeah oh yes

370
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,550
so he says what he believes right yeah i

371
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:24,610
like that so let's let's just do it yeah

372
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:29,240
i love it yeah because he recognized as

373
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:32,240
as philip was unpacking the scripture

374
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,390
i'm sure all that i want to say all the

375
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,420
cylinders started firin going thing they

376
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,220
need anything this is the one because

377
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,290
part of what i believe what i've been

378
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,510
told about this passage is he was a

379
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,949
follower of the jewish faith so he knew

380
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,990
like that's why he was reading the

381
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:49,519
scriptures and so he was going who's

382
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,370
going to jerusalem he was going to

383
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,829
Jerusalem to worship so you know and I

384
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,870
think his heart was ready and that's why

385
00:15:54,829 --> 00:16:00,110
the Spirit of God brought Philip to him

386
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,220
and that's where if you're if there are

387
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,660
people in your life right now that

388
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,930
you're praying dear Lord Jesus

389
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,280
and someone to them like pray for

390
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,200
Phillip yeah

391
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,940
pray for Phillip who's just gonna come

392
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,680
alongside by the power of the Holy

393
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,850
Spirit you know say what are you

394
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,430
thinking about this is what I'm thinking

395
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,480
about and then speak some truth in your

396
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,300
life and they're gonna come to know

397
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,410
Jesus yeah and we were like wow Jane you

398
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,170
said that so fast like as if that's

399
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,660
gonna happen but it does and so we need

400
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,210
to start praying for people who don't

401
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,410
know Jesus that someone will come

402
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,750
alongside because maybe it's your

403
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,730
husband or your wife or your child or

404
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,050
your close close friend or a mom or a

405
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,660
dad and you're like they've already

406
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:42,030
heard it from me that's okay

407
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,460
pray for a Phillip yeah pray for a

408
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:46,320
Phillip to come alongside and just say

409
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,090
hey yeah what are you what are you

410
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,890
reading yeah because the thing is

411
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,420
probably God is stirring something in

412
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,950
their heart but they don't might not

413
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,750
want to share it with you but they'll

414
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,630
share it with a Phillip yes a neutral

415
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,000
party I'm neutral party and so we have

416
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,320
to encourage you to do that and the

417
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,070
other thing I want to encourage you too

418
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,620
is if you have an extra Bible ask God

419
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,450
who you can give that to and just

420
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,450
encourage them to start reading because

421
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:15,780
God uses scripture to draw people to

422
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:18,960
himself and then a fill lip comes along

423
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,840
and can open their mind to it yes which

424
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:26,640
I just love why don't we pray Jen yes

425
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,560
okay Lord we're so grateful for the word

426
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,140
that you've given us in the Bible and

427
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,120
that we believe that it's true we know

428
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,340
that you are who you say you are Jesus

429
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,840
you rose from the dead you've called us

430
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,440
to a kingdom that seems kind of

431
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,830
upside-down

432
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,440
