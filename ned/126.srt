[Music]

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,000
hi and welcome back to the new everyday

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,500
we're so glad that you've tuned in and

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,410
joined us here on our road trip through

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,550
Midwest America we are currently on

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:58,190
route our highway 44 somewhere between

14
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:04,129
Tulsa Oklahoma and Springfield Missouri

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:05,750
and we are talking about signs and so

16
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,330
last week we talked about the fact that

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,240
God loves us has plans and purposes for

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,009
us and speaks to us through signs but we

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,380
need to be aware of how he speaks to us

20
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:18,740
and as we talked about the Word of God

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,509
we talked about prayer we talked about

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,520
people we talked about circumstances we

23
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:25,630
talked about dreams while on today's

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:30,440
show we actually want to talk about

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:32,830
signs again and sometimes we can think a

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,569
sign is leading in the right direction

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,550
but when we get there that's not where

28
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:41,659
we expect it to be and so to be mindful

29
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:43,630
of well how do we actually discern that

30
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:48,470
the sign is correct

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:50,270
so because the reason we bring this up

32
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,560
is so often we to be like what God spoke

33
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,259
to me in the sign that God spoke to me

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:59,060
in this side and even Gideon right we're

35
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:02,179
not called the judge Gideon to lead his

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,630
nation of Israel to stand up against the

37
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:08,259
Midianites

38
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:12,520
he was like well prove it to me if you

39
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:14,709
know if the lamb's wool is dry but

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,330
everything around it is wet I'll know

41
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,519
it's you and it happened and he's like

42
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,910
that's good god but can you do it again

43
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,230
while they flip it this time so

44
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,000
everywhere else around the lamb's wool

45
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,300
is going to be wet but the lamb's wool

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,500
itself will be dry and then God did it

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,970
as a sign from the Lord that he saw

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,870
confirmation on I want to be really sure

49
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:41,170
that this is what you want me to do

50
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,920
sometimes though people will think that

51
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,269
they have had a word from the Lord and

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,640
they go ahead and they walk in it but it

53
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:52,180
hasn't necessarily been confirmed and

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,250
that's where we ended off the last show

55
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,709
was on the importance of confirmation

56
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,620
that then parts of having two or three

57
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:02,739
witnesses which is so important but what

58
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,239
happens like so how do you discern and

59
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,470
you discern if that's really God

60
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,750
speaking to you so that's where we want

61
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,390
to pick this up because we want you to

62
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,569
follow the signs that God has for you

63
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,590
but not every sign is a sign from the

64
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,590
Lord right so

65
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,350
and and not every sign should be taken

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,550
at face value because not all signs are

67
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,880
what they seem

68
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:35,070
yes and so and a an example of that was

69
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,540
for us this week very clearly was an

70
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,690
individual at the hockey game that we

71
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:44,440
went to we went to Minnesota wild

72
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,840
against Vancouver Canucks and so in

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,300
Minnesota there were so many people

74
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,690
wearing the jerseys and wearing you know

75
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:56,470
the colors and all of that and so here

76
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,270
we are probably the only two maybe there

77
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,970
were two others you know actually

78
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,820
rooting for the Canucks but that was

79
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,550
fine but we made this assumption that

80
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:10,060
all these people who were there wearing

81
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:14,740
the colors the jerseys the scarves the

82
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:21,669
tooks you know were diehard fans that a

83
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:25,930
knew the game and knew the players and

84
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:28,390
knew what was happening and so a very

85
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:32,169
specific example of that was their

86
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:34,750
goalie and when their their goalie was

87
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:37,720
first announced it sounded like everyone

88
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:41,620
was booing him it sounded like a boo and

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,110
and then every time he made a play it

90
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,050
sounded again like they were booing him

91
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,900
was boo boo that's what it sounded like

92
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,479
and I finally turned it to this person

93
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,960
next to me who was wearing a Jersey and

94
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,240
I said why do they keep booing but

95
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,810
goalie yeah why aren't they building him

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,290
up and encouraging him and she said oh

97
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:09,490
they're having a really hard time with

98
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:12,460
their goalkeeping and so they're just

99
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,910
being hard on him and I'm like wow this

100
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,750
is a tough crowd and like because every

101
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,669
time you touch the pocket right like and

102
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,200
chain is getting intense she's like what

103
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:24,919
is wrong with these people they should

104
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,129
be encouraging her and I'm sitting

105
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,590
I agree like it was very disheartening

106
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:33,199
and we're like on the vancouver canucks

107
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,599
side thinking wow this is so

108
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,509
disheartening for this goaltender and so

109
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:40,249
i'm we're having this conversation back

110
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,139
and forth about well this really isn't

111
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:45,199
about affirming and how can they build

112
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,120
up his confidence and and i overhear two

113
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,060
girls sitting beside me on the other

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,319
side saying well his last name and i

115
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,499
can't even remember the whole thing but

116
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,110
this last name is starts me like do be

117
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:59,479
they surely let you do but you did

118
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,979
something group and so they called him

119
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:03,349
so whenever he touched the player

120
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:06,159
actually made a good play right they

121
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:09,560
would be like dude which sounds like boo

122
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:13,219
only it's do and all of a sudden I'm

123
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,409
like check the roster yep check the

124
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:17,360
roster there was his name well that

125
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,120
Robbie put up his real name there at the

126
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,409
bottom of the screen Thank You Robbie

127
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,089
but literally so they just took his

128
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:26,870
that's just the first three letters of

129
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:29,569
his name and actually called it out as

130
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:33,349
an encouragement right and we're sitting

131
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:36,650
there going this makes so much sense

132
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:39,439
but we sat there going this woman had

133
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,270
the garb like that he had on the Jersey

134
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,849
it sounded like what she was saying was

135
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,939
you know sounded right and yet it didn't

136
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:53,199
sit right in our spirit it sounded like

137
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:56,029
really and so that thing in our spirit

138
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,120
we want to say is something that the

139
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:01,669
Lord puts there to bring discernment to

140
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,550
things and just because one person can

141
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,810
say well this is what it is does not and

142
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,629
even though they're wearing the full

143
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,810
gear that's not true in our spirit we're

144
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:14,370
like

145
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:17,160
that's that's not very kind or

146
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,020
encouraging and as soon as you know I

147
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,300
hear these other two girls talking about

148
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,030
it and we check it out and it was like

149
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,000
the confirmation right confirmation

150
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:30,120
confirmation or like okay then that

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,919
that's the troops then and so we're

152
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,180
sitting here going wow

153
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,900
we were totally taken off-guard by what

154
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,460
we perceived as someone who would know

155
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,530
what the right thing to do was or what

156
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,390
the right answer was but it wasn't right

157
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,800
and so as we take this commercial break

158
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,210
we want you to think about when was a

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
time that you listened to someone or

160
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,830
believed someone because you thought

161
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,720
they had the right information but it

162
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,230
turned out they really did it and so

163
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:03,719
we'll be back right after these messages

164
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:06,879

continue to open up doors for us to

198
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,009
teach people and to speak about how much

199
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:39,819
God loves them in its plans and purposes

200
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:43,959
for their life so here we are talking

201
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:46,870
about signs concerning signs and how how

202
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:51,009
do we know that it you know it's really

203
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:53,259
God's voice or how to be careful not to

204
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:54,230
make assumptions that's really what God

205
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,290
is saying

206
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,720
and another as we shared before we went

207
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,810
to a break about the hockey game and

208
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,950
needing to know some information and we

209
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,170
thought we were going to the right

210
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,870
person to get the information but we

211
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:13,700
warranted and has that ever happened to

212
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:16,640
you where you feel that he went to the

213
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,610
right person but it turns out that it

214
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,110
was not very good information to begin

215
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,890
with and sometimes that can be even like

216
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,720
going I remember going to a guidance

217
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,670
leader or having a guidance either

218
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,590
speaks to me when I was in school and

219
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,930
they said Oh Jen like you need to become

220
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,450
a doctor and because you know you have

221
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:39,140
good grades and I think you do a really

222
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:41,750
good job at this and I'm thinking doctor

223
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,740
and yet they were a guidance counselor

224
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,290
so you would think they would you know

225
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,330
have an idea of what I should be doing

226
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,190
and at that point I'm just like I don't

227
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,100
think that's when I'm called to and

228
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,690
obviously I'm now a pastor I teach

229
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,250
people about Jesus and how much he loves

230
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,830
them and has plans and purposes for

231
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,410
their life but that's an example in my

232
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,200
life where I could have listened to that

233
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,670
guidance counselor and have become a

234
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,290
doctor but I would not have been

235
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,710
fulfilling the purpose that I know God

236
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:20,370
has for me and so what's interesting

237
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:22,589
about this whole idea of I want to say

238
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,050
how do we want to say it where the lady

239
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:29,100
was wearing the the jersey we have that

240
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:32,910
just sometimes signs are what you

241
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,980
perceive as a sign is just not what you

242
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,990
see at face value is not really

243
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,990
indicative of what's going on beneath

244
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:45,240
the surface and so we were talking about

245
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:49,200
that first in in Samuel no yes Samuel

246
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,920
where yes Samuel is told by God to go

247
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,339
and anoint the next king because God has

248
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,690
rejected Saul and so he's told to go to

249
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:02,790
Jesse and is going through you know all

250
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:05,250
and in his mind he's saying oh look at

251
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,230
this one and you know he's he's tall and

252
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,140
he's handsome and he's broad children

253
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,570
and and God and each time God says no no

254
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,550
no yes and Samuel is like well what's

255
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,010
going on and God says well man looks at

256
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:20,220
the outside but God sees the heart and

257
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,740
so we thought about that you know with

258
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,770
this person at the hockey game right was

259
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,620
what we saw what we saw with our earthly

260
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:31,740
eyes was the jersey but what was really

261
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,570
going on inside was someone was just

262
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,480
wearing the jersey but didn't know a

263
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:41,060
thing about the team and so we thought

264
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:45,060
about you know how as Christians we can

265
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:48,029
say we are a Christian we can go to

266
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,570
church we can so we have the right words

267
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:55,400
that we speak but that doesn't

268
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:59,240
necessarily mean we are a Jesus follower

269
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:03,270
and we've had conversations with people

270
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,230
where yep we go to church we sing we

271
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,870
sing songs about Jesus

272
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,510
and we serve and then we're like oh

273
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,700
great there Jesus flower right and then

274
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,120
you start having theological

275
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,160
conversations about sexuality or worship

276
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,010
or Bible reading and all of these things

277
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,440
and and responses that you think should

278
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,110
come from them as far as being a Jesus

279
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,030
follower are more like oh oh really

280
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,820
that's what that means are oh really

281
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:33,190
that that's what that means and and and

282
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,800
when you say well the Word of God says

283
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,330
well tell me what the Word of God says

284
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,610
and all of a sudden you sort of step

285
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,320
back and you realize you aren't

286
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,840
necessarily dealing with a mature

287
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,970
believer of Christ you're dealing with

288
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,690
someone who could very well be a very

289
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,510
immature Christian so they know Jesus

290
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,670
they've tasted the goodness of God but

291
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,890
they actually have a dove in deep and

292
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,840
allowed everything allowed the Word of

293
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,260
God and prayer and fellowship to

294
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,510
actually change who they are - right - I

295
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:08,500
want to say reorder the priorities of

296
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,910
their life and it's always like because

297
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,040
sometimes you just want to jump into

298
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,100
those conversations with people and you

299
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,510
go oh like they're in a totally

300
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,750
different place than I am and that's not

301
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:21,130
a bad place but almost sudden we can't

302
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,670
make assumptions that just because

303
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:28,090
people say they're a Christian that they

304
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:31,960
are being trained up in the ways of the

305
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:33,370
Lord and brings me to a story about King

306
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,730
Rhea bomb who was the son of King

307
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:40,240
Solomon and when King Solomon died King

308
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:43,630
REO boom was greeted by the leaders of

309
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,100
the people who said would you please

310
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,110
basically take it easy on us we have

311
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,580
worked really hard for your dad and if

312
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,310
you take it easier on us we'll work

313
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,340
really hard for you as well and so King

314
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,450
REO boom went to the elders and said

315
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,510
what should I do about this and they

316
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,800
said take it easy on take it easy on

317
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,630
them and they will serve you with all of

318
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,900
their heart and he actually didn't like

319
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,160
that response and he went to his peers

320
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,230
and said this is what the people are

321
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,450
saying what do you say in there oh no

322
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,430
like you need to stand up and say this

323
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,290
is who I am and you know my little

324
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,240
fingers bigger than my dad's like saying

325
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:19,630
I'm much more of a man than my dad was

326
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,570
and so he actually took the advice of

327
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:25,000
his peers rather than taking the rights

328
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:28,750
of the elders who had life experience

329
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,020
and as a result the kingdom was torn

330
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,840
away from him and so when we talked

331
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,120
about signs and listening to the Lord

332
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,250
it's really important who you listen to

333
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,670
like in the case of the moon with the

334
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:45,490
jersey she had wrong information and in

335
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:48,070
case in the case of conversations with

336
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,080
people who are new believers they don't

337
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,900
have the depth of experience to say well

338
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,610
this is how God actually works or when

339
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,010
you when you read this well then you

340
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,840
need to actually see well what does what

341
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,030
does the whole story of the Bible say or

342
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,520
in my experience I have seen this happen

343
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:06,040
but you that only comes with experience

344
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,500
with God and experience with God isn't

345
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,480
necessarily an age thing experience with

346
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:15,700
God is a relationship thing like you can

347
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,350
have a person who has known Jesus for

348
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,180
like 2 or 3 years but has such a depth

349
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,180
of experience with him because they've

350
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,530
fully committed fully surrendered versus

351
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,020
someone who has just gone to church all

352
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:29,890
their life doesn't have the experience

353
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:32,950
with God and so we want you to think

354
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,780
about who is it that you're listening to

355
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,580
when you're you're seeking out the

356
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,050
things of the Lord like we said because

357
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,850
maybe you're reading something and

358
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,560
you're wondering is this what God is

359
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,310
saying to me well then who do you go to

360
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,410
like it's yes you can talk to your peers

361
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,760
but are they actively reading the Word

362
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,830
of God because if they aren't actively

363
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,570
reading the Word of God either then what

364
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:55,300
are they speaking like where's their

365
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:58,330
wisdom coming from or if you've had a

366
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,550
dream or when you're wanting some help

367
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,130
and interpreting wondering you know is

368
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,020
this is this from the work is this God

369
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,970
saying to me well then you need to go to

370
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,740
someone who actually believes that God

371
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,000
speaks through dreams because some

372
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,350
people would just say well God never

373
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,089
speaks through dreams and so part of you

374
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,370
know discipleship and grooming in Christ

375
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,980
is actually pulling people into your

376
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:24,189
life being aware of people that you can

377
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,250
go to for conversation about the things

378
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:29,140
of God and what God is calling you to

379
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,630
and said but as we are not designed to

380
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,710
rely totally on ourselves for that

381
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:37,510
information like even even this morning

382
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,030
you know I had a conversation with Jane

383
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,520
we had gone shopping yesterday and I had

384
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,050
bought an outfit and but it wouldn't

385
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,830
look like I just had this sort of

386
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:49,750
squeezing in my spirit like like I

387
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,190
needed to take it back like it and the

388
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,810
Lord didn't give me a reason or say he

389
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,470
just I feel like they need to take it

390
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:59,200
back and because I'm a I know that Jane

391
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,970
listens to the spirit - she's actively

392
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,380
reading the Word of God be she's a good

393
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,720
friend and wants what's best for me and

394
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,880
is in his actively seeking the Lord when

395
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,970
I said this to her there was not a or a

396
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,110
thing of judgment it was just like yeah

397
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,780
that's what you need to do like it was

398
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,580
very much like okay like it was a

399
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,310
confirmation of what the Spirit was

400
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,500
saying to me

401
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:22,360
versus going to someone who who isn't in

402
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,610
the word or isn't seeking the Lord and

403
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,530
so that's why it's so important to have

404
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,690
people in your life that can help you

405
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,430
sort of wrestle out these things that we

406
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:35,020
feel that the gut the Lord is saying to

407
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:37,510
us so I'm not no we need to fix our our

408
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,490
camera a little bit so we're gonna pray

409
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,890
with you and then we're gonna sign off

410
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,980
for the speech so dear Lord Jesus thank

411
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:47,440
you so much that you are the God who

412
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,150
speaks and you put people in our lives

413
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,460

414
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,790
and so father we ask that you would help
