the season got some cool stuff going

226
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,100
under the tree we got to start thinking

227
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,770
about how we're gonna keep our devices

228
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,710
charged how all of those gadgets and

229
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,660
gizmos are gonna have battery power to

230
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,700
do nice yeah tonight we're gonna show

231
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,770
you three different devices that are

232
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,060
going to help you achieve that these are

233
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,520
great things to throw into people's

234
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,190
stockings and great things just to have

235
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,500
around the house as well so let's get a

236
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,890
look at what we have here for you

237
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,820
tonight

238
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:08,610
so first up now we all have devices that

239
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,530
use double-a and triple-a batteries I've

240
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,570
got some double a's here but those

241
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,880
aren't regular double 800 there is

242
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,360
something really unique about these ones

243
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,140
Jeff

244
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,120
they have monster eyelashes they do

245
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,500
adorable they're fun for the kids right

246
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,630
right you've got to be fun for the kids

247
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,760
we like nickel metal hydride batteries

248
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:30,420
because one they carry a good solid

249
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,340
amount of juice but two they are able to

250
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,440
be recharged over and over and over

251
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,190
again and you know with the caveat that

252
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,480
we do want you to when it comes time to

253
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,040
get rid of them don't throw them in the

254
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,290
trash because that would be bad for the

255
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,910
environment how these can be good for

256
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,680
the environment is you use them charge

257
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,500
them use them over and over again and

258
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,750
then you waste them recycle them your

259
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,680
city may have like an e-waste program

260
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,900
that will help with that

261
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,460
because nickel metal hydrides can be bad

262
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,970
for the environment if they end up in

263
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,500
the land

264
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,750
they didn't have some chemicals in them

265
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,390
that are not good for for the earth so

266
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:06,840
that said these particular batteries can

267
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:09,360
be charged up to 500 times so you

268
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,190
consider you know for about maybe a

269
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,550
dollar more than what you're paying for

270
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,520
your standard AAA batteries you know

271
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,080
it's really not a lot of money to spend

272
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,580
you're getting rechargeable batteries so

273
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,860
hey that's cool we've all got

274
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:26,010
rechargeable batteries we've all got our

275
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,290
nickel metal hydride charger so what

276
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,240
makes these ones special Jeff well i'm

277
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:34,100
noticing on the package that it shows a

278
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,140
microUSB it does have a micro USB

279
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,910
picture on the package you so right oh

280
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,480
and I'm just noticing that the package

281
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:48,890
is green so it's translucent on our

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:51,750
chroma key set USB charged

283
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,510
charging batteries you're right let's

284
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,700
get a look okay folks let's see if I can

285
00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:04,680
get in there oh they always do this to

286
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:06,360
me what do we see USB cable so with

287
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,310
these ones what's neat now these are

288
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,280
standard nickel metal hydride double-a

289
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:14,100
batteries these ones are 1000 milliamp

290
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,320
hours and the triple A's are 450

291
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,380
milliamp hours these batteries as you

292
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,890
can see there there is in fact a USB

293
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,470
micro port now they can be charged in a

294
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,570
standard charger so if you have a nickel

295
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,370
metal hydride charger already great you

296
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,680
can plug these into that and it will

297
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,210
charge them just as a normal

298
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,590
rechargeable battery but sometimes you

299
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,960
know if you're traveling or whatever

300
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,280
you probably don't always think to bring

301
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,350
your charger it might be a little bit

302
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,570
clunky or maybe it's just not convenient

303
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,580
or it just makes sense to have something

304
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,440
a little more convenient so these

305
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,680
batteries once they're used up and they

306
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,980
come fully charged they come with a USB

307
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:57,210
micro cable and this cable as you can

308
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,830
see has two micro ends on it and you can

309
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,880
in fact if you'd like you can buy a

310
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:04,740
separate cable from the same company oh

311
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,360
and this one has four on it which is

312
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,370
kind of cool too because like I can use

313
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,100
this for my phone as well it's not it's

314
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:14,360
USB micro it's universal right

315
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,850
so all I have to do to charge these with

316
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,100
no battery charger handy is I actually

317
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,110
can just plug the batteries directly

318
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,900
into the cable and then plug this into

319
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:26,600
any USB device like a computer or wall

320
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,430
wart my phone charger whatever it is and

321
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,950
then that will charge the batteries for

322
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,750
me see that is amazing now I mean these

323
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,040
are doublings yeah but you can also get

324
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,590
in triple A's that's right

325
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,990
what about C's and DS these put this

326
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:42,350
particular brand model are only

327
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,200
available in a and economy double-a and

328
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,910
triple-a okay I haven't yet seen the

329
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,220
technology in the larger batteries I

330
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,650
would guess Jeff that that's because as

331
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,180
soon as you get into D you're looking at

332
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,850
like how many milliamp hours would you

333
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,460
have to have I have no clue a lot right

334
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,310
you consider that a double-a has about

335
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,680
twice as many milliamps as a triple-a

336
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,450
all I know is not twice as big all I

337
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,010
know is that my kids Christmas set yeah

338
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:12,230
train that goes around the tree Oh

339
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:14,060
requires eight DS well they're advance

340
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,830
of to buy new ones cuz that sucker runs

341
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,730
out of juice after about eight hours so

342
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:23,060
they know really ass whoa yeah so you

343
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,880
can get standard D nickel metal hydride

344
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,740
batteries sure yeah but these are

345
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,560
different because they have the charging

346
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,660
mechanism built into them Jeff right you

347
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,280
have to imagine addy I'm not even sure

348
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,890
if it's if the if it would be possible

349
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,720
okay sure because you lose you know

350
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,670
there's the charging mechanism taking up

351
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,590
about you know a couple centimeters or

352
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,020
half an inch and then this is the actual

353
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,660
battery cell itself right from here to

354
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,580
here so with a d-cell you're looking at

355
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,100
a lot more milliamp hours I think you

356
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,720
you know as a manufacturer I'm just

357
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,910
guessing right I'm not a battery

358
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,560
manufacturer so I might have missed it

359
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,200
but roughly how many times can you

360
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:04,130
charge these 500 500 500 per battery

361
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,830
yeah that's so at the 500 mark is there

362
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,630
any indicator that it's just not well

363
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,810
with any rechargeable battery nickel

364
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,680
metal hydrides are in a you know perfect

365
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,140
example

366
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,670
but nickel metal hydrides are basically

367
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,620
when I say that they're better

368
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,620
rechargeable batteries so we used to use

369
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,850
nickel cadmium yeah which would not hold

370
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,020
a very good charge they didn't have a

371
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,910
lot of milliamp hours

372
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,820
and when they depleted they would just

373
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:31,399
die nickel metal hydride operate more

374
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,260
like an alkaline battery in that when

375
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,820
they deplete so when they start to run

376
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,760
out of juice they they have a little bit

377
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:40,250
of a like a curve to their depletion so

378
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,260
they start to lose power so in a

379
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,290
flashlight as a perfect example your

380
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,880
flashlight would go dimmer and dimmer so

381
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,620
you start to see oh my flashlight is

382
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,950
running low I need to plug those in

383
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,350
right whereas with a nickel cadmium your

384
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,820
light just will stop turning on see what

385
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,560
I love about these is because they are

386
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,060
just like your double-a you can use them

387
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,459
in anything I mean oh yeah we've got our

388
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Wii remotes wiimotes are a perfect

389
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:06,560
example my god oh it's crazy they're

390
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,209
always asking me for more now I can just

391
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,640
say you know plug in your batteries and

392
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:12,440
the other thing I found with we also

393
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,089
have the the balance board for the Wii

394
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,350
but we don't use it all the time oh yeah

395
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,630
what I hate is when the batteries

396
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,390
explode they explode happens all the

397
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,680
time where they get that acid leak right

398
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,270
because you know you might go a couple

399
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,649
months where you're not using it and

400
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,600
sometimes the kids don't think to pull

401
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,820
the batteries so right are these going

402
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,130
to have the acid leak any battery if

403
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,230
left in a device that is these could

404
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,180
still have any battery cable Jeff yeah

405
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,170
alright any time you're going to store

406
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,790
something you're gonna see this in the

407
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,140
manual of any electronic device anytime

408
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,180
you're gonna store something and not use

409
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,040
it for an extended amount of time like a

410
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,450
month or more you need to get those

411
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,790
batteries out of there

412
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,730
if you're if you don't want to take them

413
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,740
out and and store them separately you

414
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,290
can just slip a piece of cardboard in

415
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,029
between the contacts just to stop just

416
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,680
to stop them from being able because

417
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:59,450
otherwise you've got a constant flow of

418
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,970
electricity electricity is always moving

419
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,490
so as as soon as you've got a circuit

420
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,949
which is in the the we pedestal thing

421
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,870
it's gonna start it's gonna continually

422
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,449
draw a little bit of juice but not

423
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,610
enough to power the thing so then it's

424
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:15,530
they're gonna explode eventually so that

425
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,579
would be the case with any battery so my

426
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,559
daughter we've learned a lot here

427
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,360
tonight no but just because they're like

428
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,770
they've got the monstermouth yeah I

429
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,870
thought they were eyelashes but no it's

430
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,760
a monster mouth it's a monster now Wow

431
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,250
my daughter would love these shoes I

432
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,660
might just have to buy some you know

433
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,059
throw them in their stocking and by the

434
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,250
way if you want them cat5 dot TV slash

435
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,540
smart tools and I'm gonna tell ya tell

436
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,190
you it's a little bit of a weird way

437
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:45,950
that they spell their company name

438
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:49,670
Smarr smart to use 300 or so think smart

439
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:53,960

that are gonna help help you charge

446
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,090
devices that use usb in order to charge

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:22,970
alright stick around we'll be right back

453
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,180
project and these children will change

454
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,180
the world

welcome back this is category five

457
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,390
technology TV and tonight we're learning

458
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,850
of some devices that are gonna help us

459
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,500
charge our devices mmm that we've got

460
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:11,070
under the tree because hey here's the

461
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,600
thing Jeff have you just to put this out

462
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,990
there and maybe Sasha you can answer

463
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,030
this - okay has anyone here bought any

464
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,440
electronic gadgets or gizmos as

465
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,680
Christmas gifts for someone else this

466
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:27,030
year yes that that need to be charged I

467
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:32,460
have to remember what I bought Amazon

468
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:38,460
order purchase was not electric what you

469
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:40,830
know what I I don't know if it requires

470
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,300
batteries that's something you need to

471
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:53,520
figure out it's wrapped and under the

472
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:57,600
tree yeah that's not the answer that I

473
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,240
was expecting from my team from you

474
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,340
here's the thing we were looking for

475
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,970
specific items for Christmas yeah I

476
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,040
purchased and they were all just there

477
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,900
just happen the conglomerate that we

478
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,030
bought at that time for the Cyber Monday

479
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,560
was just not alone okay stuff there's

480
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,480
still shopping to be done I've got lots

481
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,720
of electronic gizmos for my kids you do

482
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,390
and I have this philosophy that you know

483
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,980
anything that has wires I need to be

484
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,320
careful about buying that for my wife

485
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:28,500
cuz that's just like a it's like a

486
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,620
little thing to remember yeah but here's

487
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,410
the thing so I have a smartphone mm-hmm

488
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,590
I have a tablet mm-hmm Becca has a

489
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:39,630
smartphone mm-hmm the kids have like a

490
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,670
shared smartphone that they use for

491
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,570
games and creating stick pod animations

492
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,590
and things like that

493
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:48,300
and we are now at that point where okay

494
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,180
we've got wall warts all over the place

495
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,730
all over the place even to the point

496
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,220
where it gets frustrating because some

497
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,680
of our electrical outlets are switched

498
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,870
so someone will come in to the room and

499
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,630
turn off the light switch and my

500
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,900
daughter's

501
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,880
my daughter's phone will stop charging

502
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,640
right like that's where we're at so

503
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,780
wouldn't it be nice if as you think

504
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,610
about you know these gifts that you've

505
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,840
got under the tree this year and maybe

506
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,370
you're just already at that point where

507
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,530
you've all got all different devices and

508
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,940
you need to be able to charge them where

509
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,440
it would be really nice to have one

510
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,610
docking station that would charge

511
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,980
everything oh that would be so amazing I

512
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,470
would actually have plugs again what if

513
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,610
I told you Jeff because this is you know

514
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,410
I have to sound like an infomercial

515
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:39,310
because that's what YouTube tells me I

516
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:42,880
am Jeff we've got one that slices and

517
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:46,660
dices no Joey show me yeah I know right

518
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,480
Joby's has brought out the q7 and this

519
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:52,810
one there's there's the the infomercial

520
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,540
voice the q7 as we open the box now the

521
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:58,390
q7 is pretty outstanding Jeff it's got

522
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:01,240
Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 okay how many

523
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,130
is that six ports that's six ports okay

524
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,710
can I turn this into an unboxing I'm

525
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,480
gonna actually open this up for folks

526
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,880
okay first thing that I notice is this

527
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,690
squiggly thing which is in fact is that

528
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,060
the technical term

529
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,560
yeah the squiggly thing now keep in mind

530
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,020
folks because I've seen some of the

531
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,320
Amazon reviews that this is not the main

532
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,820
selling point of the device but it is a

533
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,040
pretty cool little stand that you can

534
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,920
stand up a couple of phones and maybe a

535
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,680
tablet just to keep okay it's just a

536
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,150
little bit more organized than having

537
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,610
them all laying out on the table right

538
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,260
okay now a couple of amazon reviews are

539
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,630
saying oh well the standard is a little

540
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,060
bit flimsy not the selling point to

541
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:43,510
stand though this is the stand okay

542
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:46,270
comes with it it's a bonus it's worth 50

543
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:49,240
cents and it is what it is let's look at

544
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:51,700
the actual device what do you think

545
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,070
ready for this I'm ready okay I'm gonna

546
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,840
set this cheap little floozy stand over

547
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,760
here which actually is pretty good but

548
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,280
it is what it is is not the selling

549
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,470
point here is the selling point my

550
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:09,070
friends this is a q7 from jeebies and

551
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:11,500
this device has what AC input we're

552
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:14,380
talkin this is not like a USB hub this

553
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,990
is not sharing many many you know

554
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,270
scanners into your computer this is

555
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,490
specifically plug it in and start

556
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,870
charging your devices okay now you

557
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,310
already noticed Jeff that we've got six

558
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,220
ports now you'll notice the

559
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:31,510
discoloration of the top one yes is a a

560
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:33,910
10 watt port all the rest of them are 40

561
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:37,240
watt ports now the device itself the q7

562
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,910
will do up to 50 watts simultaneously so

563
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,410
what that means is if you plug in

564
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:43,450
several devices it's going to share the

565
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,580
wattage with many different devices so

566
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,530
keep in mind 10 watts this top port is

567
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,830
about what you get with a like an iPad

568
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:53,590
charger yeah yeah ok 2 amps or so yep so

569
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,190
all of these are actually four times the

570
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:59,230
power as far as wattage goes and they

571
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:02,530
have what did I mention at the top here

572
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:05,020
quick charge what that means is that in

573
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,960
about 15 minutes time you're gonna be

574
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,970
able to charge your phone if it's got

575
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,500
that quick charge feature you're gonna

576
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,840
be able shard your phone and get about

577
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,800
eight hours battery life with just 15

578
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,670
minutes 10 minutes

579
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,320
really yeah yeah it's awesome so the

580
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,120
other thing so you think okay well I've

581
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,380
got I've got a couple of old phones and

582
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,990
I've got a couple of new things I got an

583
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,150
iPad or a tablet or something my iPad

584
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,380
has quick charge my phone does not what

585
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,720
happens if I plug them all in together

586
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,700
now it has some safety features maybe we

587
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,380
can kind of just go over a couple of

588
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,250
those Jeff because I've listed them out

589
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,900
so safety features go okay oh you're

590
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,960
you're not gonna take it oh sorry I

591
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,360
thought you said I'm like Hindi Jeff

592
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,840
come on help me out here man I even gave

593
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,030
you a printout okay I was slightly

594
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,540
distracted by the the ticker feed on the

595
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,920
news room down below was the first night

596
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,320
that we've ever been able to see you

597
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,240
chatroom yeah yes I feel like this is a

598
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,730
like an infomercial or something where

599
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,880
attention is exactly like an infomercial

600
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:18,160
right YouTube right okay so what am I

601
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:20,120
talking about the PI killer the q7 from

602
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,640
juvies

603
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,640
a actually power a Raspberry Pi 3

604
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:34,880
protects against overcharging thank you

605
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:35,660
so if you've got over overheating oh so

606
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,520
it's got you covered

607
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,780
got you covered and if you plug in

608
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,610
multiple different devices that are

609
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,260
drawing different amperage it will

610
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,760
actually automatically adjust the ports

611
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,620
as you plug them in right

612
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,300
instantaneously and you charge

613
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,610
everything all at once now I know that

614
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,080
Chubby's does quality products yeah

615
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,860
they've got all their certification FCC

616
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,540
and all that correct

617
00:25:51,860 --> 00:26:00,110
this is 100% certified and guaranteed so

618
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:03,560
got our OHS we've got C E and we've got

619
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,790
FCC certification on this and if you're

620
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,130
unhappy with it they'll actually give

621
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,600
you your money back feel that it's

622
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:13,640
actually kind of surprising that is

623
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:15,950
solid yeah see as you're holding it up

624
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,900
there I'm looking at it going hmm

625
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,670
right on my nightstand and of course

626
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,140
anybody who cares about like waves when

627
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,330
you sleep and how it affects you they're

628
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,710
gonna be like electromagnetic stuff yeah

629
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,260
yeah what I've said they're going okay

630
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:30,320
there's my work phone my personal phone

631
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:33,800
my tablet my House of Marley headphones

632
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,450
yeah in one fell swoop and my my watch

633
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,670
I'm thinking because I've got a power

634
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,410
bar plus all these cables oh this would

635
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:43,340
be so much like you're using a bunch of

636
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:46,610
wall warts for that yeah Wow yeah cables

637
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,590
everywhere at all exactly the same set

638
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,720
up I have a power bar with all different

639
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,850
chargers on them and this will be

640
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,550
amazing and I see how clean that is yeah

641
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,710
my phone is a quick church so I mean

642
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,270
that speaks to me there you go me so

643
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,840
imagine yeah there you go that feature

644
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:05,090
is there I mean it is what it is it's a

645
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,440
very simple product from a promotional

646
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,780
standpoint you know what I can tell you

647
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:13,220
about it but it works it's great in the

648
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,390
box beyond that let's see we've got this

649
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,690
is the american-style

650
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:21,800
AC adapter of course you can get the the

651
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,950
UK different adapter as well there you

652
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,360
go

653
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,130
almost wraps for even got some cable

654
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,660
like like wraps or whatever have to kind

655
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,220
of keep everything nice and neat so

656
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,170
they've thought of it all I mean it's it

657
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,440
is what it is and it's fantastic no this

658
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,320
is

659
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,720
just a six port charger it's not about a

660
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,370
hub it's not no it's not a battery it

661
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,990
does not do anything like that it is

662
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,870
strictly something that you would plug

663
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,190
in and it gives you power right yeah but

664
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:49,389
as I mentioned you could power a

665
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,470
Raspberry Pi or six of them with this oh

666
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:55,820
definitely five because we've got the

667
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:58,639
540 amp 40 watt and 40 amp 40 Watts

668
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,379
ports there blow it up it might be a fun

669
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:02,840
experiment let's see how many raspberry

670
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:05,419
PI's we can power with that that would

671
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,259
be kind of neat I see and right in my

672
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:07,759
head I'm starting to think like

673
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,110
multiplicity I'm picturing a power bar

674
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:14,019
with all these plugged in it just

675
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,019
devices make a server

676
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,580
alright so speaking now you mentioned

677
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,210
while we were looking at the q7 Jeff you

678
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,889
mentioned your watch yes and you just

679
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,539
got back from a trip in the states where

680
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:29,350
you were out in the good old outdoors

681
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:31,100
yes how are you charging your watch

682
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,389
actually I brought it with me so I

683
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,429
charged it every night in the room but

684
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:36,429
also you were you were not roughing it

685
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:42,500
I'm picturing like a tent no no you had

686
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,409
a cabin with electricity Oh

687
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:49,330
hotel Oh a hotel it wasn't with a

688
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:49,330
Jacuzzi shaped like a heart

689
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:56,059
yeah no it's just okay so moot point but

690
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:58,129
as you're going camping or maybe you're

691
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,899
in the plane or wherever else where you

692
00:28:58,129 --> 00:29:01,850
may not have a place to charge your

693
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:03,399
stuff okay so I but this was an issue

694
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,720
because while I was in the forest

695
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,370
sitting in my stand I'm yeah I had an

696
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,250
audio book that was quietly playing in

697
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:16,190
one of my earbuds on my phone oh so

698
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:18,019
iPhone like oh yes yeah so of course now

699
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,330
we've looked at chubbies products in the

700
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:23,029
past we've looked at their earbuds we

701
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,269
had a set on a couple sets on a couple

702
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:27,700
weeks ago and you saw those on our show

703
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:31,820
and hopeful years ago we had the

704
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:33,139
amplifiers yeah amp sound and with those

705
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,289
one of the things that we've mentioned

706
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:38,809
on the show is how I love how japaese

707
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:40,789
makes cases that automatically charge

708
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:44,450
yes they're earbuds when you put them in

709
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:46,549
yes so Jimmy's heard us talking about

710
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,950
that how much we love these cases and

711
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,409
and the

712
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,120
fact that they can be charged your stuff

713
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:53,610
can be charged as you're storing it in

714
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,620
this safety pouch and so they said well

715
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,320
let's do something a little different

716
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:01,769
for those of you like Robbie who perhaps

717
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,539
or not not necessarily in the market to

718
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:06,210
buy new year buds because maybe you've

719
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:08,669
already got some right okay and let's

720
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:13,350
introduce our case to those folks so

721
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:15,809
along comes JB's for charge this is

722
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,510
fantastic folks the simplest little

723
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:20,730
thing but everything that we love about

724
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:23,909
JB's charging solutions classic Jimmy's

725
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:27,059
case love this case rock-solid there you

726
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:28,470
go it's got a USB input on the case now

727
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:31,289
keep in mind that that means that you

728
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,730
can charge the case all right

729
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,950
so now you're gonna be carrying this in

730
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,960
your pocket or wherever in your in your

731
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:40,320
bag yeah in your purse what a great idea

732
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,000
that is and then you can actually charge

733
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,730
any USB micro device that's awesome or

734
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,190
it features a USB port for other devices

735
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,990
if maybe it's not USB micro no way

736
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:55,139
charge it as well it's a thousand

737
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,850
milliamp hours and I can just take my my

738
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:59,220
earbuds that I already own so these are

739
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:03,330
not cheap easier butts and plug those in

740
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:05,070
okay just as you would with any charger

741
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,889
cable and then just tuck them into the

742
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:12,330
case okay now I noticed that you also

743
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:14,429
have your sjcam so it's charging okay so

744
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,620
you're charging your headphones yeah can

745
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:20,039
you plug another cable in at the same

746
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:22,019
time for your ass like yes question dual

747
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,710
charging yes it does have dual charging

748
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:28,440
so here's my sjcam SJ 5000 X this is my

749
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:32,610
action cam with 4k so now I can take

750
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,669
this and now it's it even included an

751
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:39,510
extra USB micro cable okay and can plug

752
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:43,139
that into my SJ can plug that into the

753
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:45,870
extra charging port and now I've got

754
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:48,779
this portable battery pack that not only

755
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:51,149
keeps my stuff safe there the sjcam just

756
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:53,340
fired up charging mode so it keeps my

757
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:55,289
stuff safe like my earbuds or other

758
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,929
small device I was thinking Jeff about

759
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:59,740
your your SmartWatch yes for example

760
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:02,050
yeah it would fit

761
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,420
fit perfectly sadly look actually just

762
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:07,120
put it in there and keep it charged now

763
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:11,140
the one caveat or the one disappointment

764
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,900
if you will if I had one is that had

765
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:17,530
Jabez made this case just a little bit

766
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:22,270
bigger I could have tried I could have

767
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:24,429
charged my sjcam and kept it closed fit

768
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:27,130
in they're not charging you're right no

769
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:30,309
absolutely Santa so I could in fact put

770
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:33,730
my sjk once it's charged I could use it

771
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:36,820
as a case for that and close it up

772
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:41,080
that's fine but there's just it's just

773
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:44,650
shy of enough room to charge my sjcam

774
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,570
while it's in the case see so if they

775
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,760
had a cable that maybe was had a flat

776
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,300
end yacht rental they would not go

777
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,400
perfect

778
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,380
yeah or if it was just a little bit

779
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,550
bigger that's how it looks with an STI

780
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,080
cam and it would be the same with a

781
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,340
GoPro or something like that so for

782
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,179
those of you who are thinking hey that

783
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:03,040
would be great for a GoPro you're right

784
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:05,340
absolutely this case the jeebies for

785
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,390
charge is perfect for that however

786
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,700
you're not going to be able to charge it

787
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,700
and close it at the same time you're

788
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:15,520
gonna have to pop that up plug it in and

789
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:19,330
just kind of leave it sitting like that

790
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,860
to charge where Oh from from that side

791
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,710
that I was gonna say if the zipper went

792
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:27,370
here at the very least it's not gonna

793
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:29,980
happen no I tried I tried but I loved it

794
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:31,870
I loved it for my ear buds and I do love

795
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,970
that it will charge other devices even

796
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,620
if they're a little bit too big to fit

797
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,480
in there or even your phone or something

798
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:41,620
like that it's great you can pick one of

799
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,480
these up at cat5 dot TV slash for charge

800
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,750
and that's the number for check those

801
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,210
out so great little devices for for your

802
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:52,090
stockings for any of these smart devices

803
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,830
that you're gonna be putting under the

804
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,630
tree this year I think you definitely

805
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,130
need to look at some new ways to charge

806
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,290
your stuff otherwise you've got that

807
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:02,170
power bar with a bunch of wall warts and

808
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:04,300
it's taken a lot of juice that works a

809
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,650
lot better so yeah pick these up now

810
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,870
that way you've got them for the road

811
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,639
trip to Grandma's house for the holidays

812
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,200
karevik yep you're good

813
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,149
they also could there's like an extra

814
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,889
present right

815
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:20,799
absolutely not when I was a kid needs

816
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,720
extra know but it look so great and be

817
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:24,190
functional right so it's gonna be a

818
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,359
great thing to open under the tree my

819
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,940
parents used to give me something and

820
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,159
they'd also wrap the batteries right but

821
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,700
this is where you can actually give this

822
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,869
as a gift right and certainly it's more

823
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,460
exciting than a pack of double-a

824
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:42,450
batteries that are just normal battery

825
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:42,450
exactly I love it stylish and powerful

review it's a stunning and powerful

829
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:59,200

Richmond and here the top stories were

871
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:48,920
following this week Google has announced

872
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:51,170
the aiy vision kit opening up a new way

873
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,350
for Raspberry Pi users to access its AI

874
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:58,090
tools the kit comprises a low-power

875
00:36:54,350 --> 00:37:00,590
Intel Nvidia ma 24 50 circuit board and

876
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,570
computer vision software that can be

877
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:06,200
connected onto an existing Raspberry Pi

878
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:08,510
computer and camera modules this circuit

879
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,670
board provides the ability to run neural

880
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:12,950
networks on the device rather than

881
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,720
having to add on an external source for

882
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:17,390
the process for processing the data or

883
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,670
using a cloud processing system the

884
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,920
software includes access to three neural

885
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,870
network models one to recognize objects

886
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,820
who want to recognize faces and human

887
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:28,160
facial expressions and a third that can

888
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:31,790
identify the difference between a human

889
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,620
a cat and a dog Google said it's aiy

890
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:35,810
vision kit could be used for a whole

891
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:38,000
range of applications including

892
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,760
identifying plants and the individual

893
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,670
species monitoring where your dog is in

894
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,160
your home seeing when your car left the

895
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,170
driveway and recognizing emotion for

896
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,030
example whether your guests liked your

897
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,250
home decor

898
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:55,760
this is the second product released in

899
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,710
the aiy line by google it's a iy voice

900
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,900
kit was released in May and enables

901
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:01,640
Raspberry Pi developers to build a

902
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,520
standalone voice recognition system

903
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,530
using Google Assistant users can also

904
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,960
add their own voice recognition and

905
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:13,370
natural language processing to prove to

906
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,470
projects so that's good I like it sounds

907
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:17,540
cool now first of all I'm kind of

908
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:21,770
giggling over here because I I hate to

909
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:23,990
grammar police my own no you didn't do

910
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:26,360
anything but we said we said in the

911
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:30,140
story that it will recognize humans cats

912
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,730
and dogs I thought immediately of it

913
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:37,340
looking at a plant and thinking what on

914
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:40,520
earth is that can you imagine though

915
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:42,770
being able to create your own artificial

916
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,840
intelligence based on this right so

917
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,180
we've got Raspberry Pi we've got all the

918
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,579
you know technology available at our

919
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,809
at an affordable price but see the one

920
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:53,300
thing about this story that I'm

921
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:56,950
struggling with a little bit is the fact

922
00:38:53,300 --> 00:39:00,410
that it's about recognizing emotions

923
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:02,300
right look in human is this not like a

924
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,680
privacy violation like if somebody comes

925
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,660
over to your house is like hey come on

926
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,130
over for coffee and they come over and

927
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,490
they're like oh I love your walls

928
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:14,540
suddenly your Raspberry Pi programmed a

929
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:16,730
liar you know it's now like listening to

930
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,819
your conversation and creating a bit of

931
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:22,670
a profiles what's good like is that a

932
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:25,760
violated privacy toolkit yeah I feel

933
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:30,349
like not really isn't your phone always

934
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,960
listening to you anyhow yeah I couldn't

935
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:35,420
now just to put a like a medical helpful

936
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,309
cool idea use for technology could it

937
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,420
help someone with Asperger's if that was

938
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:43,160
the case okay right truthfully it could

939
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,050
help with a myriad of different health

940
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,339
problems in the fact that now it's

941
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,780
watching if you can watch here your dog

942
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:50,180
is in the house you can watch where your

943
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:52,880
elderly parents is in the house if they

944
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:55,099
if they have you know Alzheimer's and

945
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,420
they wander you know right so but

946
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,250
backing up again remember this is a

947
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:01,730
toolkit so this is something that we can

948
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:04,700
develop our own technology based on the

949
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:07,910
toolkit that's made available so now I

950
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:10,099
can create my own robot that can kind of

951
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:15,500
you know interact with me and my kids

952
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:18,829
could you create a lie detector baby

953
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:21,589
well as well as could I look you in the

954
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:23,900
eyes and determine that you're lying

955
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:26,349
they've said they say what is it if if

956
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:29,510
they look to the right or something like

957
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:30,890
that yeah good but here's not suddenly

958
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,880
I'm having this like brainwave I feel

959
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,280
like there needs to be a little light

960
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,470
bulb graphic above my head we should

961
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,450
like do this as a project on a show and

962
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:41,690
have the AI just listen to our shows

963
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:45,200
every week yeah to start developing as

964
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:47,900
an assistant for what a greater yeah

965
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,940
just to see how it turns out since from

966
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:53,359
Robbie's emotions that he would like

967
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:55,690
another coffee or the next news story

968
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,690
right

969
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,869
Wow effective immediately

970
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,210
cellphone unlocking is now free in

971
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:06,940
Canada prior to this carriers such as

972
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:09,880
Rogers Telus and Bell could charge you

973
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:12,640
$50 to unlock your phone that's no

974
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,680
longer the case on top of that devices

975
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,440
must also be sold unlocked as well

976
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,660
mm-hmm so why should you care it's

977
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,820
simple if your device is unlocked you

978
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,440
can take it to any carrier get serviced

979
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,960
for it which means if your current

980
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,849
carrier isn't meeting your needs is too

981
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,700
expensive or has horrible customer

982
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:32,410
service you can go elsewhere easier on

983
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,910
top of that you can switch phones at

984
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:37,180
will without being forced into a new

985
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:39,340
plan the change also means that when you

986
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,140
go overseas you can use a local SIM card

987
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,000
at a much lower price rather than being

988
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,119
charged be charged by your cell phone

989
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,859
carrier for expensive roaming services

990
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,750
all of this is great for the consumer

991
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:51,670
but likely bad news for cell phone

992
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,619
providers as they will now have to up

993
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:57,670
their game it if they want to retain

994
00:41:53,619 --> 00:42:00,369
customers I love oh yeah right because

995
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:02,349
for the longest time my wife and I were

996
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:05,890
subscribers to a certain cell phone

997
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:10,599
provider and their customer service

998
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:12,550
suddenly became incredibly crappy so we

999
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:13,990
went to switch thankfully for my wife

1000
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:16,089
she was at the end of a contract she

1001
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,800
could just sign up for a new one I just

1002
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:21,820
signed the contract six months earlier

1003
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,400
so it cost me 50 bucks to get out and I

1004
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,390
was like that's a whole other can of

1005
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,910
worms when you start looking at

1006
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,890
contracts but what here's the thing Jeff

1007
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:32,290
what got you into that contract the new

1008
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,970
phone it was the new fun new phone but

1009
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,940
see if it was unlocked I wouldn't need a

1010
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:40,330
contract right cuz I could just find

1011
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,310
that phone already unlocked maybe online

1012
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:43,720
or something and then just go to my

1013
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,570
carry and be like hey I would like to

1014
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,640
sign up like this potentially could

1015
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:50,619
result in a lot of people not doing

1016
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,570
contracts because they already have an

1017
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:54,700
unlocked phone I'll give you an example

1018
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:57,040
of how this benefits someone like myself

1019
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:00,520
okay I have my phone

1020
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,770
yes you do which I unlocked so I bought

1021
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,599
the unlock code for this phone because

1022
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:07,390
at that time it was not free it was

1023
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:09,519
commercial and then I unlocked it myself

1024
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:11,259
so I can do that or

1025
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,719
go to my service provider and have them

1026
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:15,219
do it and pay them to do it they do it

1027
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:18,279
so that you'll switch to them with a

1028
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:22,259
phone from a competitor yes so in my

1029
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:24,939
case I've unlocked this phone and I buy

1030
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:26,140
pay-as-you-go service because I don't

1031
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:28,630
use my cell phone

1032
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,759
like at all it's it's for emergencies

1033
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,919
and for like if the alarm goes off kind

1034
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:36,159
of thing right so that's that's just me

1035
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:38,199
so I use I use magicJack at home so I've

1036
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,359
got like I can call anywhere in the

1037
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:42,849
world for free kind of thing at least

1038
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:45,429
North America so with this

1039
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:46,779
I've got like such cheap services six

1040
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:48,999
dollars and twenty five cents a month

1041
00:43:46,779 --> 00:43:50,589
and it gives me everything that I need

1042
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:52,509
because I only use Wi-Fi and phone

1043
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:56,949
service so I'm not cheap I'm just frugal

1044
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:59,769
right and and then when I go to the

1045
00:43:56,949 --> 00:44:01,779
cottage so this happens you know I go to

1046
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:05,109
the cottage and we want internet service

1047
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:08,439
well my $6 and 25 cent service does not

1048
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:10,809
have internet for me so what I do is I

1049
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:13,809
take the SIM card out and I go down to

1050
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:18,819
the local ISP and I get pay as you go

1051
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:21,399
internet right okay right that's right

1052
00:44:18,819 --> 00:44:25,449
different provider right so then they

1053
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:27,249
sell me that it's $10 for the chip for

1054
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:28,989
the SIM card right I pop it in here now

1055
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:30,549
if I had a dual SIM phone I could just

1056
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:31,209
have it in at all times and just use it

1057
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:33,159
whenever I need it

1058
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:34,899
but then pop it in and I've got LTE

1059
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:37,089
internet mmhmm yeah

1060
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:39,519
Dave and I have an unlock phone we bring

1061
00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:41,949
to Jamaica there you go yes then do you

1062
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:45,069
buy SIM card while you're there or some

1063
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:46,899
card in Jamaica yeah and I mean many

1064
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:48,459
people do that and now it'll just be

1065
00:44:46,899 --> 00:44:51,369
easier we had to pay to unlock the phone

1066
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:54,369
as well but now now they have two for

1067
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:56,469
free which actually will up everybody's

1068
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:59,409
game I think for customer service now

1069
00:44:56,469 --> 00:45:00,819
that'll be how you win customers would

1070
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:02,319
it be neat if we lived in the world

1071
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:04,989
where you had to provide good customer

1072
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:08,619
service in order to get customers I will

1073
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:11,889
I will say my cell phone company which I

1074
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:13,630
will not name but controversially like

1075
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:15,369
most people don't like them and I love

1076
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:18,279
them they give me great service I

1077
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:19,839
wouldn't switch from them even if I had

1078
00:45:18,279 --> 00:45:21,969
the freedom to which I don't cuz I'm

1079
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,770
locked it any cell phone company you're

1080
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,880
gonna have

1081
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,280
who loved it and those who hate it

1082
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,930
because they're huge right they're like

1083
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,840
here in Canada we've got like Rogers

1084
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:32,520
Bell tell us plus all there's maybe or

1085
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,200
you could say five yeah Fido's like

1086
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,420
Rogers and yeah you know you've got all

1087
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,230
this kind of stuff going on but

1088
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:40,080
realistically there are only a couple of

1089
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:43,160
major providers so pretty much I think

1090
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:46,110
Bell and Rogers on most of the towers

1091
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:49,160
have to pay rental fees and stuff I'm

1092
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:52,280
hoping that in the end this somehow

1093
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,360
drops the price of cellphone plans

1094
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,130
because of the competition aspect

1095
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,020
because they are unlocked because like I

1096
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,480
just got a text today about my cell

1097
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:03,420
phone my wife and I 218 bucks for the

1098
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,840
month I am that's no overages

1099
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,910
like yeah you'll have to buy your phone

1100
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,440
outright right you might but that's the

1101
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,860
way it's gonna work now we were with a

1102
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,840
particular provider and we were with

1103
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,880
them for a few years and we weren't

1104
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,770
generally happy with the service because

1105
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,110
at the cottage there was no signal and

1106
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:24,990
this kind of stuff right but they did

1107
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:26,730
have a rewards program so with that

1108
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,740
rewards program at the end of our

1109
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,440
contract we said okay what are our

1110
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:33,480
options now we have all these reward

1111
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,310
points we could buy a new phone with no

1112
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,869
new contract so we bought a new lg phone

1113
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:42,930
using our points I think we had to pay

1114
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:44,790
like a $25 service fee for the like just

1115
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,310
- they have to charge something kind of

1116
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,450
thing like the hook up ya know I didn't

1117
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:50,220
even get the hook up I just bought the

1118
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:54,300
phone and it would cost me 25 bucks for

1119
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:57,030
the for the $200 phone so I used my

1120
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,369
points and I got it and then I bought

1121
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,650
the unlock code unlocked it and I put it

1122
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:03,450
on pay as you go that's perfect so

1123
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,760
imagine if you could use those points at

1124
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:08,070
a provider who cannot lock that phone

1125
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,250
and so you get it unlocked anyways so

1126
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:13,200
now it's just it gives the consumer an

1127
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:16,260
unbelievable amount of freedom that we

1128
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,869
can now now we as the users can choose

1129
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,480
you know what phone we use where we use

1130
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:23,280
it I can buy a ShowMe phone if I want to

1131
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,350
and I can use it on any of my providers

1132
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,580
and you know or I can buy the one that

1133
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,320
the provider selling if they've got a

1134
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,240
promotion now this is that'd be more

1135
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,070
competitive now this is a Canadian story

1136
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,320
in that this is new to Canada are we

1137
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:35,330
ahead of or behind the rest of the

1138
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,780
countries

1139
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:40,370
do most countries offer unlocking for

1140
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,470
free or discounted price good question

1141
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:43,310
yeah it'll be interesting to find out

1142
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,370
comment below

1143
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:49,160
well who's just saying the chat that the

1144
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:55,340
rules changed in Chile in October what

1145
00:47:49,160 --> 00:48:04,550
about the US and Australia has this

1146
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:06,020
issue with the the great story so let us

1147
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,400
know yeah we'd be interested comment

00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:12,560
there in the IRC Channel

1151
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,330
what about your country are you having

1152
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,920
to pay to unlock your phone and what

1153
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:20,840
kind of freedom does an unlocked phone

1154
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:21,260
give to you now a comment came in last

1155
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,080
week

1156
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:26,990
Britney Murray was asking about

1157
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:29,300
specifically a route security bug in Mac

1158
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:35,480
and while Jeff and I who said we're

1159
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:36,920
gonna talk about it we're making good

1160
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,080
buddy that's right

1161
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,020
the serious and surprising route

1162
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,390
security bug in Mac OS hi Sierra is back

1163
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:47,000
for some users shortly after Apple

1164
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:49,160
declared it fixed the root bug

1165
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,290
discovered last week allows anyone to

1166
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,150
login or authenticate as a system

1167
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:56,090
administrator on systems running Mac OS

1168
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:58,220
hi Sierra in many circumstances all they

1169
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:00,730
need to do is simply type the username

1170
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:03,640
root and leave the password field blank

1171
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:05,780
the bug is so serious that it drew an

1172
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,240
uncharacteristically strong apology from

1173
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:11,900
Apple which said its customer customers

1174
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,940
deserve better after Apple released a

1175
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,560
patch for the initial bug some users

1176
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,170
quickly discovered that the security

1177
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,110
update caused file-sharing functionality

1178
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,790
to break apple in turn released a new

1179
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:25,340
version of the security update that

1180
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:27,770
addressed that issue now within just a

1181
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,950
few days this initial wrinkle has been

1182
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:33,740
discovered users who had not installed

1183
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:35,900
Mac OS ten point thirteen point one and

1184
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:38,180
thus for running a prior version of the

1185
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,940
OS when they received the security

1186
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:43,280
update found that installing ten point

1187
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:46,580
thirteen point one resurfaced the bug oh

1188
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,589
yeah and for these users the security

1189
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,239
update can be

1190
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:51,190
installed again in fact it would be

1191
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:53,979
automatically installed at some point

1192
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:57,700
after updating to the new version of the

1193
00:49:53,979 --> 00:49:59,739
operating system however the bug is not

1194
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:02,380
fixed in that case until the user

1195
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:04,150
reboots their computer many users do not

1196
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:06,130
reboot their computer for days or even

1197
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,960
weeks at a time and apples support

1198
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:11,289
documentation did not at first inform

1199
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,969
users that they needed to reboot so some

1200
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:16,059
people may have been left vulnerable

1201
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:18,190
without realizing it the documentation

1202
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:20,650
has been updated with the reboot step

1203
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,799
now what is this windows I don't

1204
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:27,579
understand I I reboot my computer all

1205
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:29,619
the time system are you running every

1206
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:37,210
single operating system are you running

1207
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:41,079
I run Windows but it and I ran linear ok

1208
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:42,819
but the truth of the matter is I always

1209
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:47,469
turn my computer off at the end of the

1210
00:50:42,819 --> 00:50:50,559
day am I the only one who does that well

1211
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:52,509
I think Linux users Mac users alike we

1212
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,489
really are used to the fact that when we

1213
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:56,920
run updates we do not have to generally

1214
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:58,509
reboot right yeah but even if you don't

1215
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,789
in that moment don't you at the end of

1216
00:50:58,509 --> 00:51:02,890
your usage period like I feel like

1217
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:05,410
doesn't it draw a lot of power just to

1218
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:09,519
have your computer just hanging out no

1219
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:12,160
like I've got a 24 core dual CPU Z on

1220
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:15,460
under my desk and I've got it set to go

1221
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,289
into a suspended state when it's not in

1222
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,119
use and and when it's in that suspended

1223
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:21,130
state it wakes on land and comes back

1224
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,079
with the movement of a mouse so yeah I

1225
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:24,729
just never have to turn off why wouldn't

1226
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,499
you just turn it off because then I

1227
00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:30,400
gotta wait for it to boot and did I

1228
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:33,789
mention it is a 24 core dual CPU Z on

1229
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:38,979
the post alone takes a little while yes

1230
00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:41,170
yeah I don't know I just don't

1231
00:51:38,979 --> 00:51:42,400
understand I guess maybe just because

1232
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:46,239
it's me and I turned it off all the time

1233
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,789
but oh sure now is Apple responsible

1234
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:51,719
because they let's get back on track as

1235
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:54,309
we're focusing on the wrong thing

1236
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:56,739
rebooting our computers so tried turning

1237
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:58,900
it off and on again Apple did not tell

1238
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:00,369
people to reboot their computer after so

1239
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,359
they acknowledged the fact that there

1240
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:04,720
was a problem

1241
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:06,970
they did release a fix they did not give

1242
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,269
people the last step are they now

1243
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:12,940
responsible for anybody who had possibly

1244
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:15,099
were they responsible originally for the

1245
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,900
very bug that made it so people could

1246
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:19,359
log into their computer by just typing

1247
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:22,180
route with no password like again is

1248
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:23,920
this Microsoft Windows no it's not you

1249
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,900
would expect better security from Mac

1250
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,430
and I say that a little tongue-in-cheek

1251
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,499
and people are saying oh you why are you

1252
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:31,359
knocking Windows with Windows if you hit

1253
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:33,999
control-alt-delete type in administrator

1254
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:36,819
and hit enter you will now be logged in

1255
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:39,940
as the administrator use right so it's

1256
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:44,200
it's ridiculous see but that's how you

1257
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:45,730
can hack a computer I you know I hear

1258
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,019
you ask the question satchel like is an

1259
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,119
Apple response well I guess to a certain

1260
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:51,130
degree or maybe from a legal standpoint

1261
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,269
answer is yes but I also feel like when

1262
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:57,039
it comes to computers there should be a

1263
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:59,259
certain level of common sense like you

1264
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,720
should always be like it's a computer

1265
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:04,420
it's not like it's a book it's not like

1266
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,579
it's a you know a can opener it's a

1267
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,440
computer there's a whole whack of

1268
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:10,239
personal information on there you should

1269
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,450
be thinking security minded from the

1270
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,970
get-go hmm and so things like that I

1271
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:17,170
feel like to really be told --have done

1272
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:20,049
an update you should probably restart

1273
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,400
your computer should for most people I

1274
00:53:20,049 --> 00:53:25,059
mean less like Robby said you're on

1275
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:28,420
linux should just be common sense but

1276
00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:30,279
Mac OS is a UNIX based OS as well UNIX

1277
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,380
driven yes he was my wife's computer

1278
00:53:30,279 --> 00:53:35,140
every time we do an update and because

1279
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:37,239
she has a Mac yeah it says you know it's

1280
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,950
right this is a pop-up that said I don't

1281
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:40,690
know what operating system she's on I

1282
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,640
I think it's Snow Leopard or something I

1283
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,950
don't know but you know I don't touch

1284
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,769
the thing but it shows it's a Mac OS

1285
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:48,849
snowcone she always gets a pop-up that

1286
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:51,249
says you know it's recommended to

1287
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:53,109
restart the computer and she does all

1288
00:53:51,249 --> 00:53:57,039
right would she if she didn't get that

1289
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:58,989
pop-up restart the computer I I believe

1290
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:01,930
from again what somehow we're back at

1291
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:04,930
rebooting I don't think it's the users

1292
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:07,150
fault that Mac OS made it so that

1293
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:09,460
someone can sit down at their computer

1294
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,960
and log in as root without a password of

1295
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,700
course this is not really gonna affect

1296
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,910
home users

1297
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,920
but unless you've got SSH open but if

1298
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:20,109
you are in a corporate environment a

1299
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,390
bunch of Mac's or maybe you're just the

1300
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:23,859
graphic designer and you've been you you

1301
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,720
sit in front of a Mac and all of a

1302
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:27,640
sudden you know you come into work on a

1303
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,630
Monday and it says I did some updates

1304
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,980
over the weekend do you want to reboot

1305
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:32,530
you're like no no I gotta get at work

1306
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:34,119
right right and then Joe Schmoe in the

1307
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:35,290
back finds out about this bug and comes

1308
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:38,049
up to your computer and logs in his

1309
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:40,140
route and well but see here's here's the

1310
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:43,109
thing when sasha was reading the story

1311
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:46,390
initially I thought this was the

1312
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:48,280
workaround with Mac where you can go to

1313
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:49,780
the BIOS

1314
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,390
I think it's called BIOS and Mac and

1315
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:54,460
head to the to the terminal and there's

1316
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:55,630
you can bring up a file wipe out a line

1317
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,190
in the code and that wipes out the

1318
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,329
passwords on your user accounts sure

1319
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:00,609
because I had to do that on my wife's

1320
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:03,160
Mac she we something happened the

1321
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:05,020
password didn't work and she was locked

1322
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,549
out and I spent two hours going how do I

1323
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:08,380
get in this thing yeah fine I looked up

1324
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:11,140
an up on a forum and they're like oh you

1325
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:13,030
could bypass the security this is so

1326
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,670
much more serious because this is like

1327
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:17,170
this is not CH routing into an OS and

1328
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:19,599
and going through all those steps where

1329
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:21,880
you've really got to be a pretty savvy

1330
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:26,650
user and you have to do it this is

1331
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:29,020
strictly typing in ro ot enter and now I

1332
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:31,240
have the ability to do anything on that

1333
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,619
compare so it's a little bit of a

1334
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,329
different case because we think about

1335
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:37,030
two different levels there's a real

1336
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:40,030
hacker or a really good savvy computer

1337
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:41,980
user and the script Kitty who just wants

1338
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,900
to cause damage and found a way to be

1339
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,630
able to get root access to somebody's

1340
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:49,809
Mac right so if you have this version of

1341
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:50,920
the operating system as a default you

1342
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:53,619
know you buy your Mac you get these

1343
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:56,700
gonna say reboot no no you just be aware

1344
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:58,900
like maybe put a sticky note on your

1345
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,760
your package that came with your

1346
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:04,869
computer so that if you ever have to do

1347
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:06,520
a factory rear ability on that specific

1348
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:08,980
version of the operating system don't

1349
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:12,160
get caught in the future that's right or

1350
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:14,920
just go to linux speaking of super savvy

1351
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,349
computer users facebook Messenger is

1352
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:20,319
coming to preteens strictly speaking

1353
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:22,599
only those aged 13 and over are allowed

1354
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:25,359
to use Facebook but the prevention

1355
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:26,140
methods are trivial meaning more than 20

1356
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,430
million

1357
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,920
thirteen year olds are thought to be

1358
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:32,049
using the network so on Monday

1359
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,450
Facebook launched its first app tailored

1360
00:56:32,049 --> 00:56:36,130
for young users it's a ring-fence

1361
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:39,010
network that needs parental approval

1362
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:40,779
before use and will not the company has

1363
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:43,660
promised be used to feed data for

1364
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:45,609
advertising messenger kids is a

1365
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:47,440
simplified lockdown version of the

1366
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:50,470
messaging app that Facebook currently

1367
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,510
offers to those over 13 Lauren Cheng

1368
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:54,640
product manager for messenger kids said

1369
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:56,019
parents are increasingly allowing their

1370
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,119
children to use tablets and smartphones

1371
00:56:56,019 --> 00:57:00,849
but often have questions and concerns

1372
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:03,760
about how their kids use them and which

1373
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:05,710
apps are appropriate if two children

1374
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,019
want to be friends on messenger kids

1375
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:10,779
that friendship has to be approved by a

1376
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:13,059
parent for each child once confirmed to

1377
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:14,920
be safe friends can do live video chats

1378
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:17,680
and pictures and texts to each other

1379
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:20,589
there will also be a library of kid

1380
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,140
appropriate and specially chosen gifts

1381
00:57:20,589 --> 00:57:25,660
frames stickers masks and drawing tools

1382
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:28,480
that lets them decorate content and

1383
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:30,940
express their personalities approved

1384
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,769
adults can also contact children through

1385
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,630
the app but they will still get their

1386
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:37,180
messages through the normal facebook

1387
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:40,180
Messenger app messenger kids will of

1388
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:43,180
course collect data the child's name the

1389
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:45,420
content of the messages and typical

1390
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,410
usage reports for how the app is used

1391
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,869
Facebook will share that information

1392
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:51,700
with third parties which must have data

1393
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:53,769
protection policies that comply with

1394
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:57,609
Coppa the Children's Online Privacy

1395
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:59,799
Protection Act in the u.s. Facebook has

1396
00:57:57,609 --> 00:58:02,019
promised the data will not be used in

1397
00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:04,599
any way to power grown up Facebook

1398
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:06,579
that's important the obvious commercial

1399
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:08,769
benefit to this new app might be to

1400
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:10,990
target ads to parents based on what

1401
00:58:08,769 --> 00:58:13,089
their kids are talking about or use what

1402
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:15,369
was discussed in messenger kids to

1403
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:18,450
target ads at Target ads at teens as

1404
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:20,589
they graduate into over 13 Facebook

1405
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:23,079
neither of these things will happen

1406
00:58:20,589 --> 00:58:24,910
Facebook said that the app doesn't know

1407
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:27,160
specifically how old the children

1408
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:29,170
signing up are so users will not be

1409
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:32,500
prompted to move onto Facebook when they

1410
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:34,390
are old enough if a child does decide to

1411
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,980
join full Facebook it will be a brand

1412
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,450
new account with no data carried over

1413
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:41,420
from what was sat on messenger kids

1414
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,920
as YouTube found out when videos with

1415
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,770
disturbing content found their way onto

1416
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:48,260
YouTube kids trying to make a child safe

1417
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:49,849
space is difficult a minority of people

1418
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,640
will always be looking for ways to get

1419
00:58:49,849 --> 00:58:55,609
around protections messenger kids is

1420
00:58:52,640 --> 00:59:00,500
initially available in the US on iOS and

1421
00:58:55,609 --> 00:59:04,010
will later come to other platforms wow I

1422
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:07,940
don't have kids but I'll tell you this

1423
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:10,310
seems sort of scary territory for one I

1424
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,020
want messenger kids because it sounds

1425
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:14,810
like then I'm not gonna have to deal

1426
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:16,790
with all the ads what's to stop me from

1427
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:22,339
signing up do you need parental consent

1428
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:24,680
ah dad well I was thinking as I was even

1429
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:28,190
saying that what if its siblings does it

1430
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,630
have to be separate parents that allow

1431
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,010
children I think it's got to be just a

1432
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:32,480
password protection or something like

1433
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,339
that so again what stopped me from

1434
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,839
signing up right you probably you

1435
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:38,780
probably as a parent I'm guessing would

1436
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:40,849
have to like sign some sort of a waiver

1437
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:41,900
or you know scroll past the thing that

1438
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:43,250
you don't actually read and then click a

1439
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,230
box this is yes I'm the authorized

1440
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:48,470
Guardian mmm something like that

1441
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:50,900
but yeah okay so my kids are getting

1442
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:56,230
into messaging apps right and so I have

1443
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:59,000
spent hours upon hours searching

1444
00:59:56,230 --> 01:00:01,220
researching messenger apps I'm looking

1445
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,730
for something that is going to have his

1446
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:07,640
minimal footprint on my kids as possible

1447
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:09,950
because I don't want them becoming a

1448
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,359
marketing gimmick and I mean I was

1449
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:13,490
listening we were talking about podcast

1450
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:15,380
I think it was last week yeah and I

1451
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:17,180
listened and I did listen to one podcast

1452
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:20,180
about a month month and half ago

1453
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:22,400
about Facebook's tracking algorithms

1454
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:24,680
their AI is so advanced that the

1455
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,359
creators of the a I'm for Facebook no

1456
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,920
longer understand what it does because

1457
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:33,079
it's surpassed the programming abilities

1458
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:35,300
with 57,000 categories like if this is

1459
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:36,380
what Facebook does for the adult version

1460
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,550
and they're saying yes we're gonna

1461
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,410
collect all this information with the

1462
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:42,890
kids chat but don't worry we're not

1463
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:45,140
going to use yeah I've just about said a

1464
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:48,530
bad word I don't believe it I don't

1465
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:51,230
believe it there's like so difficulty

1466
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:53,809
you you I DS you need user ID

1467
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,859
so maybe you don't it doesn't transfer

1468
01:00:53,809 --> 01:00:57,200
the data from the kids Facebook

1469
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:59,690
passenger to the adult but are you still

1470
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,680
gonna recognize the unique user ID is

1471
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,720
there still going to be a device

1472
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,210
recognition to go oh so we're not

1473
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,490
tracking it but we also know that this

1474
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:09,530
profile was created on that phone and

1475
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:12,109
that phone now has an adult count and oh

1476
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:13,640
look at that these two columns intersect

1477
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:14,660
I've got the same name hey guess what

1478
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,400
we've now got to throw in all these

1479
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,829
categories yeah I think what's hard too

1480
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,440
is that we look at Facebook and they do

1481
01:01:18,829 --> 01:01:26,540
not give anything away for free no it's

1482
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:28,280
a free service I data is a currency I am

1483
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,710
NOT on board with this I

1484
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,750
I'm sorry Zuckerberg don't trust you as

1485
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:34,460
far as I can throw you I don't buy it my

1486
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:36,559
kids will not use this it's a hard thing

1487
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:39,079
because when we were kids we'd pick up

1488
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:41,780
the phone and we make a call these days

1489
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:43,790
messaging applications FaceTime things

1490
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,849
like that are what kids are using to

1491
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:49,040
communicate texting is a big one when we

1492
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:50,329
were kids our parents could hear one

1493
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,609
side of the conversation so at least

1494
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:54,020
there was a little bit of a Oh what is

1495
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:56,150
it what are they talking about kind of

1496
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,859
like censorship from the parents kind of

1497
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,579
thing going on oh you know you've got to

1498
01:01:57,859 --> 01:02:04,339
wrap up the call where nowadays it's so

1499
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:07,430
intimate between the two kids that you

1500
01:02:04,339 --> 01:02:09,220
don't really know what's going on it

1501
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:11,990
doesn't mention anything really about

1502
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:14,839
parents being able to monitor that would

1503
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:17,480
be ideal if there was like sort of you

1504
01:02:14,839 --> 01:02:19,790
could gift your child like a segment

1505
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,770
like a kid segment of your account in

1506
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:24,589
that they can communicate with their

1507
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:26,240
friends and you oversee and make sure

1508
01:02:24,589 --> 01:02:28,880
that everything that's going on is

1509
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,950
appropriate right and not scary that

1510
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,690
would be okay with me yeah I would be

1511
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:36,230
okay with mom and dad being big brothers

1512
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:38,660
yeah not just like third parties yeah I

1513
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:40,910
don't know I don't like it okay Sasha

1514
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,740
yeah you know how much I don't want your

1515
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:44,990
grandma to be replaced by that Gordon

1516
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:46,309
Ramsay robot kitchen yeah I would rather

1517
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,720
see your grandma replaced by the Gordon

1518
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:52,880
Ramsay robot kitchen none of my kids use

1519
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:57,290
Facebook Messenger app the other can

1520
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:59,359
tell my face yeah I'm sorry about that

1521
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:01,339
but okay here's the one thing that

1522
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,680
Facebook didn't talk about all they've

1523
01:03:01,339 --> 01:03:05,000
got 27 different ad trackers that are

1524
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,760
built into various websites

1525
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,020
so how is that data gonna interact with

1526
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,940
the kids messaging app if they're using

1527
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:12,050
it on a phone there was nothing in the

1528
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:14,630
article about that saying we're not

1529
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:15,740
going to use the web ad trackers and how

1530
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:17,330
it's gonna relate to the kids messenger

1531
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:19,190
app I think there's too many facets to

1532
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:22,900
this this is a conversation that is

1533
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:25,940
going to go on for a while sorry I just

1534
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:28,070
