site and then a portion of the sale goes

122
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,100
to supporting category 5 TV now we were

123
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,980
talking before the show Sasha one of the

124
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,200
things that we want to do here is

125
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,390
upgrade our camera yes and that's the

126
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,340
you know you look at it and you think it

127
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:43,140
looks great and you know it gets the job

128
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,030
done and you do look great oh thanks but

129
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,250
it's still art here's the thing our

130
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,470
cameras are 1080p and and because the

131
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,500
show is 1080p you would think that's a

132
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,900
great match but when we zoom in of

133
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,719
course we're zooming in on a 1080p video

134
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,549
and so we're losing quality so

135
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:02,229
for example when we zoom in on Sasha

136
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:04,299
during the newsroom you may or may not

137
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:06,669
notice but it actually resuming in

138
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:08,259
digitally on a 1080p canvas so we're

139
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:11,799
losing quality in that video so with a

140
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:14,079
4k camera we would be able to zoom in

141
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:16,119
losslessly and not and not have that

142
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,509
graininess so all that to say we really

143
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:20,559
would love to get a 4k camera here and

144
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,049
that's one of the things that I'd like

145
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:25,059
to to do with some of the the revenue

146
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:28,119
that comes from things like shopping on

147
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:30,039
Amazon it's the best and if you shop on

148
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:32,079
Amazon you don't have to leave your

149
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:35,079
house to your presence just come to you

150
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,479
yeah you know and my wife Becca and I

151
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,179
sat down in the basement her on the

152
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,789
family desktop me on my laptop and we

153
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:45,129
both were shopping so we just got

154
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:48,610
another for each other but also for the

155
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:50,319
kids and and said to like so basically

156
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,669
so she wouldn't see what I'm buying for

157
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,749
her right I wouldn't see what she's

158
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,009
buying for me but we would coordinate

159
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:55,569
what we were getting for the kids use

160
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:57,579
different accounts or two days after we

161
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:58,959
actually signed her up for an account

162
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:03,610
that's smart yeah

163
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:05,769
and so that that worked so but really

164
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,189
what it changed for us and what its

165
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:10,539
changing for us is the fact that now

166
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:12,999
we've got a lot of the big stuff done

167

168
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,259
I don't have to try to find the big

169

you're thinking what's podcasting so

263
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,490
maybe we should just back it up a little

264
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,340
bit

265
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:24,420
okay so podcasting is like the new radio

266
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:27,120
if you will I mean that's it well I say

267
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,660
new it's like it's a as YouTube is to

268
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,920
video and to end Netflix as to TV

269
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:35,190
podcasting is to the old school radio

270
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,860
shows of you know storytelling and and

271
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,870
even news and everything else but it's

272
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,870
online you can aggregate it which means

273
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,850
to download or listen to new episodes as

274
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:49,080

podcast person I'm an audio well I'm an

278
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,980
audiobook person I'm surrounded by anti

279
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,770
podcasters it's not that I'm anti

280
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,310
podcasts it's I have AM found one yet

281
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:07,020
well that's part of it but I I want to

282
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,570
experience as many books as possible

283
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,209
because I

284
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,589
like I'm always on the road right so I

285
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:14,410
would I would love to read some

286
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:16,750
audiobooks is my thing I yeah I'm not

287
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:23,199
gonna lie to ya I have a brand new super

288
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:26,800
amazing computer at home what about you

289
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:29,769
I would have to say probably Josh and

290
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,120
Chuck are my go-to okay whenever they're

291
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:33,730
you know there's a new episode every few

292
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,060
days that's stuff you should know and

293
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,290
and what that podcast is is so I listen

294
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,250
to that just on my headphones from my

295
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:44,649
phone and it's every week just something

296
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,690
they want to teach you about so it could

297
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,430
be anything and so every week you've got

298
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,160
three new episodes or well two new

299
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,600
episodes and one from long ago because

300
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,120
they've been on the air for like a

301
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,440
thousand plus episodes so wonder if

302
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,310
they're the one that I listened to about

303
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,920
a month ago

304
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,670
yeah where they were they did a

305
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,529
investigation under whether your

306
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,329
Facebook actually listens to you or not

307
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,149
I did listen to one about a month away

308
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:09,880
and that doubt it because Josh and Chuck

309
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:11,889
usually don't get into technical things

310
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,490
okay it's not a tech podcast it's it's

311
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:16,000
very name so familiar like just like low

312
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,130
facts

313
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,930
okay stuff it's called stuff you should

314
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:28,329
know stuff you should know every week

315
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,300
but I have no clue you know you know

316
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,649
when you're spelling words like weird

317
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,029
and you're typing it into your computer

318
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:40,510
in that moment you're like is the I

319
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:42,519
before E except after C I before E

320
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,819
except after C is not a real rule no

321
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,350
it's not weird I'm just saying have you

322
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:51,459
ever had those instances so that's what

323
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:54,310
just happened to me oh just something

324
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:56,709
you listen to so if you are a podcaster

325
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,050
let's get into our feature now yes so

326
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,970
and and if you and this can be you know

327
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,600
if you if you're publishing videos on

328
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,850
YouTube

329
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,050
my son is is absolutely in love with

330
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:11,949
editing his own videos he's got a video

331
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:14,680
camera he's getting into that I got him

332
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:16,089
a microphone for Christmas so you know

333
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,370
all these kinds of things but when he

334
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:20,380
records sometimes the volume is really

335
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,270
loud sometimes the volumes quiet

336
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,850
sometimes he's clipping sometimes it's

337
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,530
it's too low and then he adds music and

338
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,240
you can't hear the voiceover the music

339
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,640
and right so it becomes this kind of

340
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,280
crazy you know really difficult to edit

341
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,990
and really hard for him now looking at a

342
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,090
more professional standpoint so looking

343
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,410
at say category five technology TV for

344
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,420
example here we have three microphones

345
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,390
sash is a bit quieter than me Jeff

346
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,870
it has a booming commanding voice so do

347
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:52,210
ya so what happens if one of us is

348
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,640
really loud or you know sash is a little

349
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:59,140
quieter or Sasha laughs hysterically at

350
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,730
one of my jokes so frequently yeah so in

351
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,170
those instances you need to use things

352
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,510
like compressors we have Hardware

353
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,070
compressors we've got an exciter which

354
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,860
kind of makes the sound a little nicer

355
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,170
but one of the secrets in our tool chest

356
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,500
is called off off on ik and auphonic

357
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:17,740
now takes the the the audio from our

358
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,850
video and it does a lot of magic to it

359
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,210
I'm gonna call it magic because it

360
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:24,280
really is as far as what it can do so it

361
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,740
has what's called an intelligent leveler

362
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,730
I'm just gonna kind of go through the

363
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,260
specifications here this is like just

364
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,510
off of their website off phonic comm

365
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,420
just so you have an idea what it does so

366
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:36,490
it magically fixes levels it magically

367
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,040
removes things like motor noise from the

368
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:43,570
background like that so when the ladies

369
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,520
do an in-car dashcam episode of new

370
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,160
everyday for example running it through

371
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,230
off on it cleans it up quite nicely so

372
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,200
the intelligence leveler makes sure that

373
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,540
the speakers and the music or of a good

374
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,240
level but it also makes sure that it's

375
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,520
broadcast quality so if it's too hot or

376
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,350
too loud it's gonna bring it down to a

377
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,080
proper level and it's gonna keep it

378
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,600
there throughout the entire I look now

379
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,510
it's audio only we use it for video

380
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,010
because video contains audio so you

381
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,180
don't need to understand how a

382
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,850
compressor works compressors are

383
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,410
notoriously difficult remember when we

384
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,120
were in radio and we don't always have

385
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,740
to call the engineer yes yes and in

386
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,050
radio you know that's something that we

387
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,050
use to keep the levels deejays always

388
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,970
sound better but the station lives and

389
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,040
dies by the compressor oh yeah

390
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,000
absolutely a good compressor makes a

391
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,800
station sound good

392
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,390
compressor makes it sound horrible so

393
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,560
with this you don't need an engineer you

394
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,360
don't need to be an engineer you don't

395
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,220
even need to understand how software how

396
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,500
to do anything other than click your

397
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,240
mouse about three times that's it

398
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,600
loudness normalisation is another

399
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,960
feature that specifically is what keeps

400
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,750
that peak limit at that broadcast level

401
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:02,260
so we do minus sixteen decibels which is

402
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,240
podcast and you know online audio so if

403
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,470
you watch last week's episode and then

404
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,260
this week's episode you'll notice that

405
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,550
our levels the volume is exactly the

406
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,280
same have you ever been watching cable

407
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:16,990
TV and the commercial starts and it's

408
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:18,310
super loud and you because the

409
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,610
commercials are not going through the

410
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:28,960
broadcast compressor oh so it's not the

411
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:30,340
same levels yeah so so with us from

412
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,400
episode to episode you're never gonna

413
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,590
have to worry about adjusting your your

414
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,240
audio your volume right and that's

415
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,850
because of a phonic it has audio

416
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,920
restoration which removes the hum and it

417
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,140
does some filtering magic that cleans up

418
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,700
low frequencies gets rid of that kind of

419
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,530
low Rumble stuff that's really annoying

420
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,990
as you're listening on headphones or if

421
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,960
you have a subwoofer there is a

422
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:56,170
multitrack version indeed that allows

423
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,570
you to take multiple audio sources and

424
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:02,290
mix them together and it will do magic

425
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:04,360
across all of these multitrack files so

426
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,610
for example if if we were recording our

427
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,250
mics separately we could actually in

428
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,750
fact equalize it all in a much more

429
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,430
intuitive way but it does great with

430
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,660
just a stereo or mono track as well

431
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,040
right

432
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,050
but so that's two different versions

433
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,970
there's a multitrack and just a normal

434
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,140
like pump a wav file into it and it'll

435
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,630
do it

436
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,280
it has they've been introducing on their

437
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,450
web version because you can do this

438
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,090
without software you can do it on the

439
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,850
website speech recognition which is very

440
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,580
very cool so what does that do it is it

441
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:37,360
just how does that work recognizes

442
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:41,140
speech it creates web the VTT file which

443
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,929
is a format that is basically closed

444
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,070
captions for web right so if you if you

445
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:46,110
do a podcast and you want closed

446
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,120
captions

447
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,750
this is a way to do that it also makes

448
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:55,290
it so that the text that you speak is

449
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:57,690
able to be searched that's cool yes so

450
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,420
love that now we're using similar kind

451
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,700
of technology here to create our closed

452
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,890
captions I'm using automatic closed

453
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,530
captioning and we actually have a github

454
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:11,520
repository where folks like yourself can

455
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:13,860
submit edits to our actual captions so

456
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:20,510
get on over to github comm slash cat 5

457
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:20,510
TV slash well you'll find it there

458
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,700
go to my github page and you'll see if

459
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,290
you do a search in the repositories just

460
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,140
do a search for captions I think it's

461
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:34,410
called like cat 5 TVs - captions or

462
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:37,020
something like that alright then it also

463
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,090
does encoding so it'll save them to FLAC

464
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,679
files it works with multiple different

465
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:45,630
file formats now mp3 AAC mp4 whatever

466
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:49,610
and you know so on and so forth so it

467
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:53,309
cleans this up right here's the thing

468
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:56,850
Windows only ok no it's not Windows only

469
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,290
it's Windows and Mac only no Linux no

470
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,630
Linux it's just so when I said Windows

471
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,520
only I'm a Windows or Mac Windows or

472
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,290
Linux user I don't have a Mac so I don't

473
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,480
think too much on the neck side of

474
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:09,960
things but it's Windows or Mac that's

475
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,090
available ok so tonight I'm gonna show

476
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,150
you the software but I'm also going to

477
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:21,150
teach you how to install it and make it

478
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:22,860
work in Linux yeah so we're gonna learn

479
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,470
how a phonic works how it does all this

480
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:28,080
magic what it does and we're also gonna

481
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,510
learn how to do how to make it work in

482
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,669
Linux so that said if you're doing this

483
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,260
on Mac or Windows you don't need to

484
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:36,150
follow all the steps to get it working

485
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,650
on Linux because you're not on Linux but

486
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,440
I wanted to show you because a lot of

487
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:44,250
podcasters are using free software like

488
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,929
audacity on on a blue - for example so

489
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,700
here's an opportunity for you to clean

490
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:49,650
up your audio now this is a commercial

491
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,870
software you can buy it outright and

492
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,380
then you own it and you get updates for

493
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:57,270
all time basically but also there is an

494
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,940
online version that you can just upload

495
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,190
your files to and you get two hours free

496
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,710
per month and it will Qasim yeah it's

497
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,789
very cool especially if you're a smaller

498
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,740
you know you're doing little little

499
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:10,289
files and I'm shorter files now we do

500
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,080
probably about ten hours a week so yeah

501
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,879
so it wouldn't work for us but and

502
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,570
another reason that I don't use the

503
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:20,070
online version personally is because I

504
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:24,000
found that's how we first started using

505
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:26,940
it I found that exporting the audio from

506
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,490
my video and then uploading the audio to

507
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,379
uh phonic then waiting for it encode

508
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,210
then downloading it back and then

509
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:35,429
transmitting it back into my video was

510
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,600
just a pain yeah that's a lot yeah but

511
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,669
if you're a podcast and you've got an

512
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,110
mp3 file throw it on there let it clean

513
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,570
it up and download it and put it on your

514
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:45,269
website you're done yeah HD video is a

515
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:48,539
whole other can of worms that's so

516
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:51,629
honorable - lets get right into it I've

517
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:54,080
got a bare-bones install of a boon -

518
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:58,470
seventeen point ten so here we are it's

519
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,090
November of 2017 as we broadcast this so

520
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,179
this is the current version of a boom -

521
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:05,820
I'm going to jump into terminal and

522
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:09,899
there's a couple of prerequisites that

523
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:12,330
I'm gonna need - to do this and before I

524
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:13,620
do now I've already downloaded I'll just

525
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,000
let you know just in case we had any

526
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,289
internet dropouts or whatever I already

527
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,299
downloaded off on it but I'll show you

528
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:21,629
how you can get it if you head on over

529
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:23,669
to a phonic comm and then up at the top

530
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:25,080
right hand side once you're logged in so

531
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:27,269
create an account it's free to do so

532
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,539
you'll see a button that says desktop

533
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:31,980
apps and when you go there just scroll

534
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:34,529
down to the one that you're looking for

535
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,139
so as I mentioned we've got the this

536
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:39,779
standard like single file batch

537
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:42,179
processor that's a phonic leveler and

538
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,590
then we've got a phonic multitrack now

539
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,600
tonight we're gonna look at the Afon ik

540
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,269
leveler but they're both going to

541
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,860
function fairly similarly but the

542
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:51,360
multitrack does require that you have

543
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,580
multiple files so this tells you all

544
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,559
about it go there check it out and then

545
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,740
download latest version so once you've

546
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:01,320
purchased it you can click on that and

547
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,419
then you've got two options mac and

548
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,929
windows so I'm actually going to

549
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:09,299
download the Windows version ok for my

550
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:11,580
Linux machine there quick question about

551
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,680
the track you said it requires more than

552
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,110
one track yeah

553
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,700
more than one file more than one track

554
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,560
okay all right so what happens if you

555
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,840
happen to have a single file one day do

556
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,130
you that you want leveler okay but when

557
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,800
you buy one license you're good for both

558
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,240
no they are two different products all

559
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,860
right let's serve two different purposes

560
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,540
now that said you could technically put

561
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,830
your track into the multi if you want

562
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,470
the multi track version you could hack

563
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,200
around it by creating a single file that

564
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,180
is muted right that's just quiet right

565
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,620
and because it's put it as the second

566
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,040
track and so be it

567
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,890
right that's fine or you could do left

568
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,050
and right okay you could separate the

569
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,480
stereo tracks and turn them into two

570
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,650
tracks if you wanted to so now I've

571
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,250
actually so I've already downloaded

572
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:00,200
those so if I look in downloads there

573
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,770
they are I've got both of them there so

574
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:08,510
I can't run Windows programs on Linux

575
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:10,790
you know that so what am I gonna do if I

576
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,500
click on it and what does it do oh it

577
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,970
opens it an archive manager and then

578
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,590
gives me an error so that's the kind of

579
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,910
thing that you're up against on Linux

580
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,120
since Ashley you and I had a little talk

581
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,920
about this using wine and even

582
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,890
VirtualBox or something like that to

583
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,250
virtualize wine allows you to install

584
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:30,260
and run Windows applications on Linux so

585
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,860
that's what we're going to use it's

586
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:36,110
basically it's a layer between Linux and

587
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,450
the Windows application that gives you

588
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:42,740
the capabilities of running Windows

589
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:45,530
programs so sudo su on aboon - is going

590
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:48,980
to let me become route and I simply need

591
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:52,190
to install so I go apt technically I

592
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,800
should do apt update ampersand ampersand

593
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:58,460
which says if this is successful then

594
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,170
apt install wine and there are two

595
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:04,760
different versions that I can go with so

596
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:07,580
if I do app search wine - let's see what

597
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,070
it gives me we've got wine development

598
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,970
and wine stable so right now on November

599
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:17,960
in November of 2017 stable is 2.0 point

600
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,780
two and development is 2.18 so I

601
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,130
actually want the development version

602
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,050
because it has features that are not

603
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,970
available in the stable version there

604
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,140
they haven't made their way there yet so

605
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,390
I'm gonna get the latest and greatest

606
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,930
it's not considered stable it has some

607
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:35,330
things that have not passed like full

608
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,800
testing at this point but it works very

609
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,890
very well and we want those extra

610
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:44,380
features so I'm gonna go apt update

611
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:46,730
ampersand ampersand apt install wine -

612
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,050
development and if you're having trouble

613
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,610
running some of your Windows programs it

614
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:53,960
may be because you're running the stable

615
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:55,760
version of wine because that is it's not

616
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,590
as far along and it's always growing

617
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,080
it's always getting better do you want

618
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,390
to install all this stuff haha we're

619
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,630
here these would I'm doing its what I

620
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,010
said it could've used - - yes and that

621
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,670
would have done it for me so this goes

622
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,710
through now Ubuntu and Linux Debian what

623
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,630
they do is they go out on the web and

624
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,640
they just grab the files and install the

625
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:20,870
things that you asked for so when I say

626
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,010
I want wine - development it is grabbing

627
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,510
it off the internet and that's what's

628
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,920
happening right here I don't have to

629
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,870
find it on the web I don't have to

630
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,480
compile it I don't have to remember the

631
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,390
days when Linux was complicated you

632
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,950
stand it here enjoying a cup of joe

633
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:36,350
we're chatting it up and just watching

634
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:40,310
it download and get it stuff like that

635
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:42,920
it's just going away going away Oh 100%

636
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,590
now it's extracting there we go so now

637
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,830
it's installing extracting setting up

638
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:51,770
everything that we need in order to run

639
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:53,450
Windows programs on Linux and I mean

640
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,570
even as we've just been talking you'd

641
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,950
see how quickly it accesses the files

642
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:00,920
downloads them installs on legate's it's

643
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,870
not like it takes a long time no this is

644
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:07,220
no we're talking minutes here all right

645
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:08,510
I might get a couple steps we're not

646
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:12,110
gonna make you sit through all of that

647
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:13,190
though but this is again at the top of

648
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,780
the show I mentioned that we're a live

649
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,400
show so you get to see everything as it

650
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:21,740
happens so if our internet went down

651
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,600
right now that's happened it's happened

652
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,210
and that's why I downloaded a phonic

653
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,530
ahead of time just in case but why and I

654
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,610
wanted to show you the process of

655
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:33,620
actually installing that so with wine so

656
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,480
this is only applicable if you're using

657
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,240
Linux ok folks so if you're on Windows

658
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,030
and Mac don't worry about it

659
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,280
with wine now that's it I think you can

660
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:45,460
install wine on Mac yes you can

661
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,800
so so maybe you do want to listen up if

662
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,420
you're a Mac user and we need to talk

663
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:54,610
about that exploit that happened this

664
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:57,580
week as well yes but it allows you to

665
00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:01,960
run a lot of Windows programs on Linux

666
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:04,840
or Mac presumably so it's not gonna run

667
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,800
every program and as I mentioned we're

668
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,800
going with the development version

669
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,260
because it runs more programs it's got

670
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,929
more features that allow more programs

671
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,309
to work so the stable version maybe you

672
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,290
would have trouble without phonic if you

673
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:21,130
do make sure you install the development

674
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:23,770
version mm-hmm I've got wine done so now

675
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:26,890
you say okay now I can no I can click on

676
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:29,980
it right well no I still have an error

677
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:33,010
and so this is where people say and and

678
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,080
I'm saying I'm generalizing but I looked

679
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,730
at forums who were trying to figure out

680
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,220
how can I get off on it to work on on

681
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,540
Linux and people are saying it just

682
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,980
doesn't work and wine doesn't work when

683
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,530
I install it it doesn't do anything and

684
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,600
and you know it doesn't what am I

685
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,910
supposed to do now I installed it so

686
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,920
let's do phase 2 well learn a little bit

687
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:53,470
of Linux absolutely all right so right

688
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,140
now yeah we can't just double click on

689
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,700
it it's it's not we're not there yet so

690
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,070
what I'm gonna do instead I'm gonna go

691
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,800
into my downloads folder it's case

692
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,450
sensitive on Linux and Mac so those are

693
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,610
my two executive uh files I can't run

694
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:11,470
them there yeck sees their windows files

695
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:14,070
but I have wine first of all I notice

696
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:19,059
that I am currently root ok

697
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:20,830
you must become non root in order to do

698
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:23,590
this because a non-word well I've

699
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:25,420
installed it as root right I need to be

700
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,700
my user because who's gonna use it root

701
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,920
right no fair enough I'm gonna use it so

702
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,350
I need to create my wine profile as

703
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,520
Robby so I'm just gonna type exit which

704
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:44,340
takes me back to the Ravi user Who am I

705
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:48,370
Robby if it says Stanley I'm like what

706
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:50,680
so now that I am me and I'm I'm back

707
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,240
my downloads folder let's get back in

708
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:58,000
there there we go I'm gonna just simply

709
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:01,630
type wine yeah ah phonic level urge you

710
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,610
on one win dot exe hit enter first thing

711
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,670
it does is it sets up wine see that the

712
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,880
wine configuration is being updated so

713
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:12,250
it's not installing yet it's in fact

714
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:18,070
configurating wine configurating yes

715
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:25,420
again so I can do that cuz I own the

716
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:27,070
show so come on now v dictionary it's in

717

718
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:34,420
of the year what do you notice look at

719
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:37,290
that looks a little Windows II it does

720
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:43,390
mm-hmm I agree

721
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:44,890
Georg anybody asks I read that where are

722
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,290
you gonna install it now I don't have a

723
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:51,880
C Drive what are you talking about well

724
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:54,400
what wine did when I ran it just there

725
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,309
and it configurated itself for a bit

726
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,720
watch this

727
00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:01,630
control al I'm only showing you this

728
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,490
just so that you see there's wine in the

729
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,410
wine full go away made a drive shit made

730
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,059
a drive see that contains all your

731
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,890
windows stuff it's awesome so it's not a

732
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:11,679
real drive it's just a folder within

733
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,840
your home folders treat right so that's

734
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,360
where it's gonna actually put it so C is

735
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,800
actually saving in my home folder in a

736
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,020
subfolder of that so I'm just gonna hit

737
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:24,700
install and just see what happens look

738
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:26,830
at that go oh yeah nice and quick just

739
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,860
like you would expect right completed

740
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:32,470
what okay so there's one more thing that

741
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,950
I need to do we're gonna be working with

742
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:38,830
WAV files wave uses a tool called lame

743
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:42,309
and unlike the name it is absolutely

744
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:45,300
awesome so we need to install that again

745
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:48,070
Linux I need to become rude again and

746
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,270
apt I don't need to update again because

747
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,650
they probably haven't released new

748
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:55,740
versions in the past five minutes

749
00:31:50,650 --> 00:32:00,340
install lame well that was easy

750
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:01,690
boom alright so now I can click on to my

751
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,430
applications

752
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:10,540
and what do I see look at that

753
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:14,050
auphonic yeah so moment of truth here

754
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:21,430
folks Willa phonic leveller run on Linux

755
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:23,200
click it oh it worked ok you have to

756
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,430
activate it I need to activate it

757
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,080
because it is as I said it's a

758
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:28,270
commercial application right so I'm

759
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,990
gonna grab my password here so we'll

760

just conveniently change screens perfect

761
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:40,360
yeah grab that password that's exciting

762

don't come onea what it does yet we

764
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,320
don't but we don't cover wine enough to

765
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,300
show just how to get access to some of

766
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,330
these programs for those who are purely

767
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,600
linux users mm-hmm so it's great to even

768
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,010

Windows program on a free operating

772
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,190

811
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,569
when you did a feature where you were

812
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:01,220
walking around with this bad boy the h4n

813
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:02,479
he needed auphonic to fix the levels

814
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,470
because you were talking like this and

815
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:05,029
then you'd hold it out and you were

816
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,069
three feet away from the person you were

817
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:08,269
talking to which is why I went close so

818
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:11,690
you've got the day yeah yeah exactly

819
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:13,759
exactly so let's just you know move this

820
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:17,900
thing around as if okay so hey here's

821
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:19,700
Robbie and Jeff hello and over here at

822
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:25,420
Sasha I can't really reach over because

823
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,420
we're on different case that's all I get

824
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:33,799
oh yeah exactly

825
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:36,529
so the point with auphonic is it's going

826
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:38,450
to make the levels sound a lot better so

827
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:39,680
let's let's get a look at what's gonna

828
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,839
happen here so I'm just gonna stop our

829
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,749
recording alright and we're gonna go

830
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,670
file export audio I'm just gonna slap

831
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:48,829
that on my desktop and we're gonna just

832
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,630
call this test dot wave that was a solid

833
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:51,529
podcast I tuned in every oh yeah

834
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:56,239
absolutely

835
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:59,450
god that was educational inspiring

836
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:03,019
uplifting yeah absolutely

837
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:05,900
deserve a broadcasting that's we just

838
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:09,019
got a webby for that okay here we are in

839
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:12,079
off phonic now at this point it's the

840
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:16,430
same for Windows Linux Mac so don't you

841
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:19,369
worry this is this is the same interface

842
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,019
for you so if you're on Windows you

843
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:23,210
didn't need to do all the wine stuff now

844
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:25,729
we've got a file here you saw it go in

845
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,950
I'm gonna open it it's on my desktop

846
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:30,849
which is in home

847
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:33,310
Robbi desktop test dot wave its grabbed

848
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:35,760
it so if I've got some low noise hum and

849
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:39,820
stuff like that I simply can turn on

850
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,710
noise and Hum reduction easy-peasy

851
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:44,230
it has the adaptive leveler and the

852
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:47,400
high-pass filter and I've set it to and

853
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:50,980
I said decibels - 16 decibels no loops

854
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:54,430
and then we've got all these you know it

855
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:57,369
shows you the standard - 16 is is pretty

856
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:59,290
standard for podcasts ok so there we go

857
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:03,010
files ready to go I'm gonna hit process

858
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:05,109
all files and that is all I have to do

859
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:08,589
oh that's it that's it

860
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:10,329
oh I'm picturing when you're talking

861
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:12,910
about the software that you're gonna see

862
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:17,530
like the wave levels and all that it's

863
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:21,220
ok sonic is is gonna fix the audio for

864
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:23,890
us all right now let's look at the let's

865
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:34,210
look at the wave table now so bring that

866
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:36,130
up into audacity oh I closed acid that's

867
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:41,020
why they called it that I feel like we

868
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:43,660
need the jeopardy music here exactly so

869
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,369
but that worked and I mean it went

870
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,290
through and then that was quick and it's

871
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:49,630
done well I mean the podcast was only

872
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:51,339
four hours long alright one of the

873
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,540
things that you'll notice it gives you a

874
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:54,160
little bit of a report here I'm just

875
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,619
gonna see if we can see that behind here

876
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,810
it also detects things like if you've

877
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:01,750
got music playing and it will it will

878
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:05,099
find the points that are music and it

879
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:08,770
will adjust accordingly Wow look at that

880
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:13,270
notice we don't clip everything looks

881
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:14,950
clean and levels are and positively

882
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,480
beautiful and I believe this is the

883
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,670
section where I went real close to the

884
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,250
Michael jr. I see yeah I think that was

885
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:27,730
it you think it is ready so okay

886
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:29,410
oh I don't know that we can hear yeah

887
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,750
I'm pretty sure that was it so what

888
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:34,030
we're gonna do let's bring up the the

889
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:36,640
other file as well so the original so

890
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:40,120
that you can see the difference as far

891
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,650
as wave table goes so

892
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,690
is a visual representation of the audio

893
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:49,120
Wow that's our original recording and

894
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:52,600
how do I ask over Anna phonic let's just

895
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,370
do this that's now okay so yeah that's

896
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,780
worth yeah and even where sasha was

897
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,910
speaking at near the end of the file

898
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:02,320
there yeah like you could really see the

899
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:04,780
difference so what I'm gonna do we can't

900
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,730
play this to ourselves right now but

901
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,610
what I'll do is I'm gonna play this for

902
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:28,900
you so a moment of silence this is a

903
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:32,410
clip from the original recording now

904
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,050
here is the exact same clip run through

905
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:38,980

can you point with a phonic is it's

908
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:47,140
going to make the levels sound a lot

909
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,340
better so let's let's get a look at

910
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,440
what's gonna happen here so I'm just

911

917
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:11,200
a while to to do it to take to get off

918

920
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,860
I used to use level later I used to use

921
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,230
all kinds of filters and try to fix

922
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,550
things up myself this does a better job

923
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,920
than any of the other tools that I've

924
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,050
ever used it's a one like just a couple

925
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,750
of clicks to just make your audio sound

926

this

973
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:41,020
is the category 5 TV newsroom covering

974
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:44,260
the week's top tech stories with a

975
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,220
slight linux bias I'm Sacha Rickman and

976
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,190
here are the top stories were following

977
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:50,410
this week members of an exclusive club

978
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:52,930
that is restricted to selected graduates

979
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,850
of Oxford and Cambridge universities are

980
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,710
being warned that computer data

981
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:59,770
containing their personal details is

982
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:01,840
feared stolen the club believes that a

983
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:03,190
backup hard drive has been taken from a

984
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,530
locked room inside its London

985
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,360
headquarters the information stored on

986
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:10,000
it is said to include names home

987
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,060
addresses phone numbers and some bank

988
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,100
details the 5,000 members including

989
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:19,120
celebrities such as Stephen Fry have

990
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:21,070
been there have been affected both the

991
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:24,060
police and the members have been

992
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:26,590
notified and private investigators hired

993
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,600
although the Duke of Edinburgh and

994
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:30,940
Prince of Wales are honorary members of

995
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,680
the club data about them has not been

996
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,680
exposed according to the Telegraph

997
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,810
however it did add that Lord Reese one

998
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,180
of the country's leading astrophysicists

999
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:42,610
is among those thought to be affected

1000
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,620
the UK's Information Commissioner's

1001
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:46,480
Office says that companies need to

1002
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,340
protect their patrons data it's

1003
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,920
suggesting the use of encryption as well

1004
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:56,080
as ensuring that quality doors and locks

1005
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:58,810
are used Wow so like an actual situation

1006
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,060
where information has actually like like

1007
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,320
the hard copy has been stolen oh yeah we

1008
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,970
have this happen in a Canadian

1009
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,220
government office remember that oh yeah

1010
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:09,790
that's right years back when I think it

1011
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:12,010
was like like Social Insurance numbers

1012
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:14,380
and everything yeah if I recall

1013
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:16,420
correctly was like potentially an

1014
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,580
Interpol type thing Oh hanging out with

1015
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:22,450
another country oh wow

1016
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:24,610
well there but it's just a hard drive

1017
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:26,770
full of data so here you know 5,000

1018
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,990
members and and the hard drive has the

1019
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:31,960
data on it right I wonder if it's an

1020
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:34,750
employee even if it's a lockdown if a in

1021
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,390
a very exclusive club so if it wasn't an

1022
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:39,490
employee it's got to be somebody who's a

1023
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:43,830
member of the club and these are folks

1024
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:46,119
that are not probably in need of

1025
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,470
stealing a hard drive

1026
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:49,809
I feel like you're implying that

1027
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:51,249
encryption wasn't done like the hard

1028
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:53,140
drive wasn't encrypted I'm not really

1029
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:57,220
saying they did say that it was

1030
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:58,749
password-protected but what that means I

1031
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,519
mean is it an Excel spreadsheet with a

1032
00:44:58,749 --> 00:45:04,420
password on it that can easily be brute

1033
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:10,269
forced who knows that's the thing that's

1034
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:12,609
not the last of this yeah right all

1035
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:14,799
right the Pentagon's Defense Advanced

1036
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:17,380
Research Projects Agency or DARPA is

1037
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:19,539
funding researchers who are working on

1038
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,730
some kind of mind-control chips that can

1039
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:24,190
be inserted into human brains to fix

1040
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,539
mood disorders the researchers from the

1041
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,569
University of California and

1042
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:29,710
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston

1043
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:33,009
have reportedly begun testing

1044
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,990
closed-loop brain implants these neural

1045
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:36,910
implants use artificial intelligence

1046
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:39,279
algorithms to detect various mood

1047
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:41,710
disorders and to deliver electric shocks

1048
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:44,559
to jolt a person's brain back into a

1049
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,480
healthy state the implants which

1050
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,339
generate electrical pulses to control

1051
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,019
human feelings and behavior can

1052
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:51,640
stimulate the brain to treat mental

1053
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:54,430
disorders including dementia and

1054
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,140
Alzheimer's experts also believe that

1055
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:58,539
the chips can be beneficial to patients

1056
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,309
with a whole range of health issues like

1057
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:03,400
Parkinson's disease and chronic

1058
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:05,559
depression the chips have already been

1059
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,230
tested on six volunteers who have

1060
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:10,509
epilepsy and have electrodes implanted

1061
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,099
in their brain to help researchers track

1062
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:14,440
what is happening inside their brains

1063
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:16,299
throughout the day as part of their

1064
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,309
trial the researchers tracked the

1065
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:20,349
volunteers brain activity and moods in

1066
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:22,210
detail over the course of one to three

1067
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:25,049
weeks and eventually created an

1068
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,670
algorithm to decode these changing moods

1069
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:29,680
further analysis helped the researchers

1070
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,819
discover that delivering shocks to areas

1071
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,680
of the brain that involved

1072
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:35,410
decision-making and emotions can

1073
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,839
significantly improve the participants

1074
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:40,059
performance in set tasks such as

1075
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:43,180
matching images of numbers or

1076
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:44,920
identifying emotions on faces the group

1077
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,960
is currently working with neuro

1078
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:51,309
ethicists to address the moral

1079
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,739
implications of the project that's my

1080
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:56,980
big concern right there is the moral

1081
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:58,539
ethics of the project I mean I think

1082
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,920
it's cool if you can get a little chip

1083
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:03,160
that you know potential

1084
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,160
we could eradicate some of those things

1085
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:09,130
like epilepsy yeah I mean that'd be

1086
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,510
amazing but I mean how quickly could you

1087
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:13,950
turn around and be like well we're just

1088
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:17,950
gonna implant this into our soldiers and

1089
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:19,450
suddenly you're controlling people what

1090
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,240
if you're doing it afterwards and

1091
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:25,589
controlling some PTSD

1092
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,589
how is this gonna play into marriages

1093
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:35,980
look at my face look at my face do I

1094
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:36,970
look happy no I'm not happy with every

1095
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:43,500
implant you get a free marriage

1096
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:45,549
certificate love this like to help

1097
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,160
against something like chronic

1098
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:50,770
depression or absolutely or pure drug

1099
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:54,069
free right drug free solution and what

1100
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:57,490
is the brain but like the organ that is

1101
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:59,559
an electrical impulse machine it makes

1102
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:01,000
sense that it's too complex we don't

1103
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:02,950
understand it you can't just open a

1104
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,549
computer and say okay what's wrong with

1105
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:09,430
this I'm gonna start short-circuiting

1106
00:48:06,549 --> 00:48:11,650
some of the electrical components see

1107
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:13,780
and some of it isn't like I'm thinking

1108
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:17,410
something like depression right you know

1109
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:20,619
that's a serotonin level like that's not

1110
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:23,349
something that you can you know fix with

1111
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:25,720
a shock to the brain I mean well perhaps

1112
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:27,640
maybe it's not the serotonin that's the

1113
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:32,859
problem it's the the like the reuptake

1114
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:35,920
errs like they cuz depression drug is a

1115
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:39,010
serotonin reuptake inhibitor so the

1116
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,450
serotonin gets yes this is what it must

1117
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:45,490
feel like to hear me talk about

1118
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:47,020
computers it's true I was listening to

1119
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,730
the radio on my way into the studio

1120
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,190
today and and interestingly enough there

1121
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:52,750
was a show on where people were in the

1122
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,160
audience we're asking questions and then

1123
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,960
they had professionals in the industry

1124
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,819
answering these questions it was really

1125
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,040
quite entertaining and and informative

1126
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:03,579
and one of the questions was what is the

1127
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,980
cause of chronic pain and how how does

1128
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:08,290
it exist if there is no injury right and

1129
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,119
the the response from this professional

1130
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,319
from a university I didn't catch their

1131
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:13,020
name or anything like that and didn't

1132
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:16,890
even intend to speak about it

1133
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:19,210
said that it is actually the the neurons

1134
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:21,790
in the pain receptors and everything

1135
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:23,500
else misfiring and and providing the

1136
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,849
wrong information so you think that

1137
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,410
there's pain and your brain says there's

1138
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:29,530
pain and you feel the pain but the pain

1139
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:30,970
doesn't exist and so they can't diagnose

1140
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:37,119
it they can't fix it they can't you know

1141
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:38,980
what do you do how many Warrior amputee

1142
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,710
--zz have that what's called phantom

1143
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,930
limb syndrome sure you know so I mean

1144
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,609
there's a lot of potential good that can

1145
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,650
come from this but I think again I go

1146
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:49,420
back to my first comment the moral

1147
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:52,180
implications I think this could go real

1148
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,980
bad real fast if it's not reined in

1149
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:57,220
right which is why I'm happy they have

1150
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:00,250
some wasn't neuro ethicists oh yeah that

1151
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:02,589
was good to see but yeah but like

1152
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,540
anything where where's the line and who

1153
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:06,550
who gets to control the technology I

1154
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,470
would volunteer for this I would

1155
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:12,390
volunteer to have it done and here is

1156
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:15,940
why because it said increased

1157
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:18,040
performance in numbers and functions

1158
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:19,720
could you imagine if finally after

1159
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,190
getting a chip implanted in my brain I

1160
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,609
would understand the things that Robby

1161
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:26,349
said I don't think it works that way so

1162
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:28,180
helps you focus but take this to the

1163
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:29,710
next level I mean we already know all

1164
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:33,599
the analytics that come from cell phones

1165
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:35,859
and your web usage imagine having that

1166
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,589
integrated with the chip that reads your

1167
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:41,230
emotions that's it it reads emotions and

1168
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:43,780
it under in it interprets yeah because

1169
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:46,440
it's it's an AI I mean if it then goes

1170
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:49,180
move hey I can manipulate you from a

1171
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,599
marketing standpoint and invoke these

1172
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:54,520
emotions yeah with these I mean like I

1173
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,470
mean the sky's the limit with this

1174
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:59,440
technology but man could it go bad and

1175
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:01,119
and you think well they can't control

1176
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,010
people's minds they can't put thoughts

1177
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,270
into your head and say you know but they

1178
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:08,050
can certainly walk you down the road

1179
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:10,810
well here here here's a suggestion do

1180
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:12,910
this or still that or or beat up that

1181
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:15,130
guy you can't they can't do that it's

1182
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,599
not that kind of mind control but have

1183
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:19,300
you ever been you know on your way to

1184
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,670
work you're feeling pretty good and some

1185
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,220
idiot cuts you off and all of a sudden

1186
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,080
there goes your day yeah you know or

1187
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,210
somebody you know something happened

1188
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,230
somebody mistreats you when you're

1189
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,090
checking out for your coffee or

1190
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,310
something and and it can ruin your day

1191
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:34,600
and then it affects in turn your

1192
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:37,180
attitude and the way that you treat

1193
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,850
other people throughout that day and you

1194
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:41,470
know the shirt folks it's hard yeah it's

1195
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:43,600
hard to regulate emotion in situations

1196
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:45,730
like that the facial recognition for

1197
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,930
moods would probably be great for people

1198
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:49,420
who suffer from something like

1199
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:52,800
Asperger's and where they have a really

1200
00:51:49,420 --> 00:52:04,000
hard time empathizing because they don't

1201
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:06,640
easily read emotion on others getting a

1202
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,730
drone for Christmas just a heads up you

1203
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,620
may need to qualify to fly in the UK

1204
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,310
under a new legislation planned by the

1205
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,400
government

1206
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:17,350
drones weigh more than 250 grams could

1207
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,020
also be banned from flying near airports

1208
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:23,470
or above 2 or 400 feet in a crackdown on

1209
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:25,630
unsafe flying police will also be given

1210
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:27,010
new powers to seize and ground drones

1211
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:30,310
which have been used in criminal

1212
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:32,410
activity the bill has been welcomed by

1213
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:34,150
the pilots union which has warned of

1214
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:35,920
near misses involving drones and

1215
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:38,410
aircraft saying that there have been

1216
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:43,480
eighty-one incidents that so far this

1217
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:46,330
year up from 71 in 2016 and 29 in 2015

1218
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:48,610
the union's general secretary Brian

1219
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,680
struttin said these proposals are a sate

1220
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:52,930
a step towards the safe integration of

1221
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,730
drones but until the new rules are in

1222
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:57,490
place the threat of a serious collision

1223
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:59,260
remains the proposed bill to be

1224
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,940
published in the spring would ensure

1225
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:03,490
that owners of drones weighing more than

1226
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:06,550
250 grams would need to register and

1227
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:08,380
take a test Wow

1228
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:11,680
I wonder if that will be like our

1229
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:16,230
written test or a flying test or not be

1230
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:19,930
cool yeah it's actually a race all right

1231
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:21,160
drones flying through a course or

1232
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:24,150
something like that no I think it's a

1233
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:26,080
it's literally just registration and and

1234
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:28,180
answering the test like a g1 or

1235
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:32,260
something it's it's like a written test

1236
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:35,800
yet it's time for that for sure yeah the

1237
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:38,350
UK's Information Commissioner has huge

1238
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,059
concerns about ubers data policies and

1239
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:42,670
ethics following a

1240
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:45,910
that exposed the details of 57 million

1241
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:47,469
customers and drivers uber did not tell

1242
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:50,410
anyone about the breach and actually

1243
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:53,229
paid a ransom to hackers to delete the

1244
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,880
data Deputy Commissioner James Dibble

1245
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:57,249
Johnson said that these actions were

1246
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,319
unacceptable the ride-sharing company

1247
00:53:57,249 --> 00:54:01,569
does have a resource page for those who

1248
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,979
may be affected Deputy Commissioner

1249
00:54:01,569 --> 00:54:04,779
James Dibble Johnson said the

1250
00:54:02,979 --> 00:54:06,130
Information Commissioner's Office would

1251
00:54:04,779 --> 00:54:08,259
work with the National Cyber Security

1252
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:10,390
Center to determine the scale of the

1253
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:13,569
breach and how it affected people in the

1254
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:15,640
UK as well as considering the next steps

1255
00:54:13,569 --> 00:54:18,880
that uber needed to take to comply with

1256
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:21,759
its data protection obligations next

1257
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,709
year EU countries will radically alter

1258
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:26,109
data protection laws to offer consumers

1259
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:31,180
greater control over the data that they

1260
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:34,420
share with companies Wow so uber not

1261
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:41,529
only kept the breach a secret but then

1262
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:43,900
paid a hacker I guess today yes when it

1263
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:47,400
comes to uber I feel like they've just

1264
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:51,400
had about 12 months of complete

1265
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:54,099
butt-kicking Ayana I'm just screwing up

1266
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,349
front on various levels like every time

1267
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:59,949
they'd gone ahead something went wrong

1268
00:54:56,349 --> 00:55:00,279
and they my my feeling is they dealt

1269
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:03,009
with it

1270
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:05,589
not necessarily correctly and this is

1271
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:09,819
just another step in the case and it's

1272
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:13,630
it's too bad if if you pay a hacker to I

1273
00:55:09,819 --> 00:55:16,239
guess if you pay a hacker then how do

1274
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:20,589
you know how do they have proof that the

1275
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:25,569
hacker deleted the data that just to sir

1276
00:55:20,589 --> 00:55:27,039
you oh yeah I deleted that data the one

1277
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:30,369
that actually leaked the story right now

1278
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:34,029
they have the data and ethical hacker

1279
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:37,420
that they knew or had reference to do

1280
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:41,499
you think so maybe they paid her ransom

1281
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:42,640
I did so that's not very talked about we

1282
00:55:41,499 --> 00:55:44,979
talked about them

1283
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:48,039
no that was DJI I'm mixing up my stories

1284
00:55:44,979 --> 00:55:50,289
yeah it makes me think about DJI story

1285
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:51,990
last week and how a hacker was using the

1286
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:56,160
the bug bounty program to

1287
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:58,710
show that or to you know submit a bug

1288
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,980
yes and had connected I wonder if it's a

1289
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:03,870
similar case to that oh that's true so

1290
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,510
in in this particular case though I mean

1291
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:08,010
we got a look at the fact that this is

1292
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:12,450
what over a year ago that this occurred

1293
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:14,480
so now the question comes up well why

1294
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:17,040
are we just hearing about it now who

1295
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,960
leaked the information I mean not every

1296
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:24,210
news news sources telling where the

1297
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:27,300
story came from but in fact the this is

1298
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:29,220
it the CEO or not the CEO but the head

1299
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:33,420
honcho anyways that it ooh BRR it was

1300
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:36,260
replaced maybe it was the CEO so that

1301
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:40,530
can get part of it and so he actually

1302
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:44,360
well first of all fired the the folks

1303
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:47,790
that covered it up yes but also then

1304
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:50,490
released press release letting people

1305
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:52,470
know that hey this has happened and it

1306
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:55,290
happened under not under my watch but

1307
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:57,690
under the last guys why and you know so

1308
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:59,460
that that plays into it as well yeah so

1309
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,770
he's trying to clean up I think which is

1310
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,030
good mm-hmm it's a great service so I

1311
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:04,980
hope that they get it together and

1312
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:07,100
they're able to that's the thing is I

1313
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,930
mean they do offer good service

1314
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:13,800
it just it's like man some bad calls

1315
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:17,640
have been made speaking of a good

1316
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:20,520
service Skype call and messaging service

1317
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,430
has been removed from app stores in

1318
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,410
China including the Apple App Store

1319
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:26,940
Apple says it's one of several apps to

1320
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:29,000
have been removed after the government

1321
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:32,130
said it does not comply with local law

1322
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,500
Skype owner Microsoft told the BBC the

1323
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:36,360
app had been temporarily removed and the

1324
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,800
company was working to reinstate the app

1325
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:41,040
as soon as possible

1326
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:43,560
the app is also no longer available for

1327
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,290
download on Andrew Android app stores in

1328
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,690
China media reports suggested

1329
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:51,270
disruptions of Skype started in October

1330
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:52,860
Apple said in a statement we have been

1331
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:55,650
notified by the ministry of public

1332
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:57,990
security that a number of voice over

1333
00:57:55,650 --> 00:58:00,570
Internet Protocol apps do not comply

1334
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:03,500
with local law therefore these apps have

1335
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:04,790
been removed from the App Store in China

1336
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,950
Skype

1337
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:10,070
when downloaded from outside China's

1338
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:12,470
Firewall has been seen as a semi secure

1339
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:14,630
way of discussing sensitive topics away

1340
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:17,600
from the eyes and ears of China's state

1341
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:19,250
security Skype is just the latest in a

1342
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,110
string of foreign owned digital and

1343
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:23,540
Internet platforms including alphabets

1344
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:27,680
Google Facebook and Twitter which are

1345
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:29,390
unavailable to Chinese users Wow

1346
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,340
what do they do in China if they don't

1347
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:33,410
have like Twitter and Facebook they have

1348
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:35,150
their own stuff yeah that's right yeah

1349
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:40,580
and it's government monitored and

1350
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:42,260
government controlled regulated and do

1351
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:45,110
you think that it'll ever be a lot I

1352
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:47,180
guess maybe if Skype allows it to be

1353
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:49,940
monitored yeah that would be the thing

1354
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:53,810
if Skype were to put servers in China

1355
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:57,380
and make them monitor a bull by the

1356
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:58,790
government then but see the way the way

1357
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:01,640
things work though is when there's an

1358
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:03,260
app that works well somebody in China

1359
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,330
comes up with their own version of it

1360
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,440
right I see it all the time so it's only

1361
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,090
gonna be a matter of time before they

1362
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:10,730
have their own version of Skype which

1363
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:12,920
will then have integration with regular

1364
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:14,540
Skype but because they'll they'll be

1365
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,920
there back they won't be allowed to do

1366
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:18,680
integration they won't be able to tap

1367
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,730
into calling to Skype because that's the

1368
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,940
whole thing that's about regulating

1369
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:24,830
although as you say if it was if it was

1370
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:29,570
a regulated app that was connected to

1371
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:33,860
Skype then that app could be yes could

1372
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:35,330
it could I can't see that's such a hard

1373
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,850
thing could you imagine being a software

1374
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:40,250
developer and releasing something like

1375
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:42,500
Skype maintaining its servers

1376
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:46,130
maintaining the service making it so

1377
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,780
that I can call China for free and then

1378
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,150
having them to shut it down yeah

1379
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:55,750
there's potentially a billion plus

1380
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:58,100
customers right now I cannot imagine Wow

1381
00:59:55,750 --> 01:00:02,740
China's a big country you want to be

1382
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:05,270
able to market to them and have services

1383
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:06,740
accessible so maybe Skype will come up

1384
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:07,970
with a way of making it far more

1385
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:10,190
accessible and then be allowed to

1386
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,960
reintegrate I think about all the like

1387
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,520
foreign exchange students and everything

1388
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,950
and you know that's how we communicate

1389
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:19,140
back with with you know parents

1390
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:23,700
it's family members and stuff so that's

1391
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:25,560
certainly be tough tough on them views

1392
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,270
like I know with some of the online

1393
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,800
games that I play you know we keep

1394
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:31,910
connected outside with an app called

1395
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:34,260
discord and it's got the right shot -

1396
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:36,330
that'll be blocked if it isn't already

1397
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,670
well there's lots of users from China

1398
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:40,710
yeah yeah I mean you've got kale which

1399
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:42,900
is also a Chinese chatting app I believe

1400
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:43,890
they've just added video integration you

1401
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,540
know so I mean there's lots of other

1402
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,130
ways around it it's no different than

1403
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:50,990
like whatsapp or whatever so yeah there

1404
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:53,910
are the ways but yeah for now

1405
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:55,530

know again get on to our YouTube channel

1422
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:40,530
it's been erupting over there as of late

1423
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:43,800
I stirred the pot when I said a

1424
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:45,240
raspberry pie killer yes apparently

1425
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,480
that's something you're not supposed to

1426
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:53,340
say that was like a hornet's nest you

1427
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:56,850
kicked lots of people yes not just not

1428
01:01:53,340 --> 01:02:03,150
opinionated but loyal loving fans of the

1429
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:04,710
raspberry pie oh yes oh yes but I see

1430
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:06,090
and you tried to comment on it many

1431
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:07,440
times I think the thing that was missed

1432
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:10,500
is that it's not necesarily that's a

1433
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,900
raspberry pie killer but it's the fact

1434
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,940
that you get four times the speed at

1435
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,130
double the price like just the price

1436
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:20,820
point standpoint some people could go

1437
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:21,540
why would I not move over to here and so

1438
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,010
right

1439
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,210
yeah and I'm certainly at that point

1440
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:26,370
where I want something faster more

1441
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:28,320
powerful for certain projects but I

1442
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:29,790
still use my PI 3 for a bunch others I

1443
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,380
just ordered one on Monday there you go

1444
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:32,880
yeah

1445
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,700
if you're not sure what we're on about

1446
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,710
go to linux tech show calm you'll see

1447
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,810
the video if you click on videos there's

1448
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:43,610
a there are a couple of videos about the

1449
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:46,770
Raspberry Pi as of late about the Odroid

1450
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:48,830
xu4 queue this is what I called the

1451
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:51,300
Raspberry Pi killer it is an 8 core

1452
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:52,950
single board computer so you know it's

1453
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,680
