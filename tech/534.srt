nimble streamer and a lot of times

50
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,329
people hear things on the air and

51
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,950
they're just like okay yep moving along

52
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:27,340
moving along they say it every time what

53
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,660
on earth is that so let me just tell you

54
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,910
a little bit about something that

55
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,220
happened to us here at category 5 this

56
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,900
week now there are a lot of things that

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,340
happen behind the scenes that you may

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,049
not know about one of those things is

59
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,120
somebody who has sponsored us for years

60
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:45,850
that you may have never heard of their

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,410
name is sig Lazaro now I would encourage

62
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,319
you to please check out their web site

63
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,560
sigla Cerro comm and they provide

64
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,200
hosting streaming services colocation

65
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,720
for dedicated servers if you want to

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,160
host any kind of server at all they're

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,310
the folks to call now they've been

68
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,940
sponsoring category 5 TV for years what

69
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,910
have they been doing

70
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,459
they've been hosting the very co-located

71
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,280
server that runs our nimble streamer

72
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:15,310
software so when we here at the studio

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,319
send a feed to that server it then goes

74
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,730
out to everywhere so that's whether

75
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,139
you're watching on roku Kodi Plex any

76
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,239
where that you are watching it goes

77
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:29,739
through that server in order to get to

78
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:32,109
you so unfortunately that sponsorship

79
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,579
has dried up only because now it's not

80
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,810
something that we've done it's it's

81
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,060
simply the fact that they're

82
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,879
restructuring the company and now it's

83
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,709
time to move along now understand that

84
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,190
these folks have been sponsoring us and

85
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,800
bringing you the live feed for years

86
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,600
remember when we first introduced Roku

87
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,420
that's when it started

88
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,090
so really yeah so think back that far

89
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,650
and consider that every single week

90
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,450
these folks have been providing our

91
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,700
bandwidth and our streaming service

92
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,650
they've done it in the background no but

93
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,570
we didn't have to mention them on the

94
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,670
air we didn't have to do advertising for

95
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,260
them it's just they love what we do and

96
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,970
they wanted to support us and our

97
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:15,250
viewership so that's come to an end so

98
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,750
this week it is it is absolutely sad and

99
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,549
and we appreciate the folks over there

100
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,459
Pablo has been absolutely fantastic

101
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:23,500
quick to respond to emails and quick to

102
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,840
solve issues whenever we've had them but

103
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,690
they've been old reliable as far as our

104
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,050
stream hosting goes so with that this

105
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,130
week came the need to decide okay what

106
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,020
are we gonna do next

107
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,780
how are we gonna keep doing this

108
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,290
broadcast category five technology TV

109
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,180
every Wednesday night live and so we

110
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,850
started looking at this device from

111
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,460
logic supply it's a CL 100 it's a little

112
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,080
micro server computer and it's got a

113
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,610
nice little kick behind it it's got a

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,190
lot of horsepower for a little tiny

115
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,160
thing a little bit bigger than maybe two

116
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,470
Raspberry Pi computers side-by-side as

117
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,740
far as the form factor goes with this

118
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,480
now it's got Debian on it and I've been

119
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,360
using it as a development server for our

120
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,490
our new version of NEMS which is coming

121
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,330
out you find out more about that at nems

122
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,919
Linux comm and so just as a test because

123
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,760
it's such a quick oK we've got to come

124
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,490
up with a solution

125
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:22,210
I installed a nimble streamer on that

126
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,500
hardware yeah so what does that mean to

127
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,540
you and this goes back to my question

128
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,890
what is nimble streamer you hear about

129
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,120
it on the show you know that we've

130
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,330
mentioned it and we're actually going to

131
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,800
show you in coming episode in a coming

132
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,320
episode what it actually does and how to

133
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,930
configure it but what it does is it is

134
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,210
the software that when we send a single

135
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,980
feed it sends it out to however many

136
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,220
thousands of people are watching on any

137
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,290
platform so it makes it compatible it

138
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,200
makes our one feed compatible with Roku

139
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,090
Plex and cody and all that so having had

140
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,610
to reinstall this software nimble

141
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,560
streamer what does that mean one I've

142
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,360
got to install the current version it's

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,259
the one that was just released in

144
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,810
November

145
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:05,590
so it's very very current then I have to

146
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:08,860
reconfigure all of our feeds No yes and

147
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,930
I was a little bit oh oh no right you

148
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,850
know that's a lot of work to reconfigure

149
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,530
but here's the thing as I was

150
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,590
reconfiguring these feeds so we got

151
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:21,430
rokuko' d-plex all those back up our

152
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,169
website live dot cat5 dot TV those four

153
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,110
things now set up on nimble streamer and

154
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:28,660
then I got looking into some of the

155
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,220
features of WMS panel which is provided

156
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,130
by nimble streamer and it allows you to

157
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,199
configure it and lo and behold they've

158
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:41,770
brought out the capability to now also

159
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:45,100
Simula to blow away and simulus

160
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,169
to Facebook live so if you're watching

161
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,870
this for the very first time tonight on

162
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,760
Facebook live or YouTube live know that

163
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,479
it is thanks to nimble streamer running

164
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,099
on a logic supply CL 100 little

165
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,490
microcomputer that you're able to do

166
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:03,190
that notice today coming into the studio

167
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,340
yeah the driver it's like category 5 is

168
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,320
live one there you go so I think this is

169
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,389
a great opportunity for us to branch so

170
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,240
you know it started out as a bad

171
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,949
situation and you know these guys have

172
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,770
been supporting us for so long yeah

173
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,060
bless them for doing that and now we've

174
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,639
got to find another solution

175
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,880
here we are nimble streamer is still the

176
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,130
software we're using to do it and that

177
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,110
makes it possible to broadcast now on

178
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:34,840
our website live cat 5 TV Roku Kodi Plex

179
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:38,199
Facebook live YouTube live all at once

180
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,970
from one sheet now further to that one

181
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,490
final comment about nimble streamer and

182
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,470
how we've got it set up now is that if

183
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,270
you go to live cat 5 dot TV

184
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,060
during the live show you're gonna notice

185
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,020
something has changed previously you

186
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,780
would have been getting the feed at

187
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,870
1080p okay that's how we distribute the

188
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,550
show that's our feed right now because

189
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,729
of the way nimble streamer is set up and

190
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,900
rebroadcasting is now using full HLS 1

191
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:07,840
you no longer need Flash Player that's

192
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:15,139
gonna make so many people happy Oh

193
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:18,169
- its HLS it is adaptive bitrate what is

194
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:20,000
Robbie what does that mean no longer do

195
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:21,650
you have to watch in 1080p if you've got

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,510
a slower connection it will

197
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:31,130
automatically step down to 720p 480p

198
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:32,900
360p right 144p all through that service

199
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,300
very cool

200

and better all the time we've been

216
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,280
talking to our friends over at B&H cat5

217
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,380
dot TV /bh their photo video store in

218
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,320
the US and they've sent us a couple of

219
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,630
new cameras to give a try - okay because

220
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,770
we're at 4x last week at the end of the

221
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,750
show I promise you we're gonna be

222
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:30,020
looking at a 4k camera this week well

223
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,640
sorry I've got three of them and we're

224
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,440
gonna show you just quickly we're not

225
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,820
doing unboxings or demonstrations or

226
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,500
anything tonight so before you get ahead

227
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,160
of me just want to show you what they've

228
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,810
sent so what this is is with a 4k camera

229
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,050
the intention is that we're gonna be

230
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,780
able to punch in on a 1080p cam shot on

231
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,240
4k canvas and we're gonna get really

232
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,130
crystal-clear view even when we're

233
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,140
zoomed in beautiful stuff so here in a

234
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,910
studio that's a great thing to have so

235
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,010
they've sent a few for us to look at

236
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,050
there's another there's a JVC pro cam

237
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,390
that's on its way as well it's gonna be

238
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,339
here in about a week or two okay but for

239
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,670
now okay so we've got three different

240
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:12,770
tiers of of cameras so this is a

241
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:14,600
consumer camera it is a FDR a x53 from

242
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,970
Sony these ones are kind of neat because

243
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,280
they've got floating optics so you think

244
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,480
about you think about a stabilizer

245
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,649
system yeah

246
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,019
normally you'd have to have a pretty big

247
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:26,060
heavy rig in order to get those really

248
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,010
smooth shots well do you remember when

249
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,230
we looked at the sony action cam and how

250
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,019
great that was yes this has got that

251
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,250
floating optics so it actually moves

252
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,600
inside the camera in order to get that

253
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,310
smooth shot okay

254
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,160
here in the studio we're working on a

255
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:42,980
tripod doesn't really matter to us but

256
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,959
it is a 4k camera at 30 30 frames per

257
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,399
second it's gonna do a really nice job

258
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,130
for us we're gonna try that out over the

259
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,019
next couple of weeks then in a little

260
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,810
bit of a higher price point but pretty

261
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:58,850
similar price is a prosumer panasonic

262
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:00,350
this one is the WX f99 one and I haven't

263
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,000
really gotten this one out of the box to

264
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,260
take a look at yet but looking forward

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,760
to giving it a go as well

266
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,560
this is Panasonic's offering that's

267
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,170
about equivalent as far as price goes

268
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,550
and again it's a 4k 30 frame per second

269
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,850
camera and that's what we're finding

270
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,769
with the 4k cameras and you know until

271
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,660
you get into the 20 30 40 thousand

272
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,060
dollar range they're all gonna be 30

273
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,649
choice surety frames a second is what

274
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:26,120
you're gonna get from 4k at this point

275
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:28,579
we're not seeing 60 P in 60 frames per

276
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,870
second in the consumer kind of

277
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:35,389
entry-level prosumer and entry-level pro

278
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:37,339
cameras yet then we've got another one

279
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:41,930
from sony this is a big step up from the

280
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:44,690
FDR IX 53 this is the ax 100 and this

281
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:47,630
one is more of a professional camera and

282
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,269
again it's 4k with 30 frames per second

283
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,680
and all of these have HDMI output

284
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,420
incidentally so they can go into

285
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,740
Telestream Wirecast and all that kind of

286
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,480
stuff so we're gonna be looking at all

287
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,579
three of these cameras plus the JVC

288
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,350
that's on its way to us looking forward

289
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,579
to doing that for you if you have any

290
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,190
questions you know maybe you're in the

291
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:07,130
market to purchase a camera whether it

292
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:10,399
be for your own personal use or for

293
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,420
studio like here we'd be happy to answer

294
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,029
those questions we're gonna look at

295
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,000
things like comparing the ISO components

296
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:19,130
and the f-stop and how how good the

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,949
picture is how well we can punch in at

298
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:25,029
1080p 720p and so we've got a lot of

299
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:28,370
exciting stuff coming for that kind of

300
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,589
high-end consumer into the prosumer line

301
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,899
of video cameras which kind of

302
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:34,279
transcends the studio environment and is

303
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,079
you know for even

304
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,509
you know you want to take videos of the

305
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,209
kids the a x53 is probably a great

306
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:43,009
camera because if you're walking around

307
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:44,959
it's got that stabilization system to

308
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:46,370
give you the smooth movement and we're

309
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,939
gonna be looking at all these over the

310
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,310
next little while

311
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:51,980

328
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:55,050

chat room I'm hyperactive this is one of

343
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,360
our biggest fans on YouTube folks so

344
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,899

345
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:44,790
Kyle now says stop calling it a

346
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:49,120
backplane okay so will Google this

347
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:55,600
backplane Oh a backplane is the back of

348
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:57,819
a t-shirt what a backplane is when you

349
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,829
have a backplane that you plug hard

350
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:02,259
drives in to or other components like

351
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:07,059
the one we were demonstrating right

352
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:09,639
thank you for pointing out that Graham

353
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:23,649
pink ten says please learn how to

354
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:25,269
pronounce SATA sata3 expecting SATA well

355
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:28,480
they could be or they could be expecting

356
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:31,389
SATA either one would be acceptable just

357
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,090
like SATA which stands for incidentally

358
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:38,750
serial ata

359
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:42,970
would you say serial Atta or if you had

360
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:45,170
an IDE hard drive would we call it I did

361
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,970
here's what worries me about this

362
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:52,850
particular comment have they ever

363
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:56,540
watched me in the newsroom and any city

364
00:15:52,850 --> 00:16:01,220
or town or village or any serial ata has

365
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:05,300
three accepted pronunciations SATA SATA

366
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:08,020
SATA that's it in some circles if you

367
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,450
say SATA or SATA you might get bullied

368
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:16,010
apparently according to our biggest fans

369
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:21,920
on YouTube if I say SATA I may also get

370
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:30,230
bullied nice deadzone says no can't

371
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:36,410
pronounce SATA lmao look pay attention

372
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:40,760
here we've already covered this virus Z

373
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:44,630
says fires that could be virus Zed okay

374
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:47,960
maybe I want to say virus Z now we're

375
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,580
gonna get a canadian-american let's get

376
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,620
into it

377
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:55,010
4:46 the girl is green screened in why

378
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,420
is she green screened in first of all I

379
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,340
think we need to get the context here

380
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,330
obviously we're looking at a reference

381
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:04,760
here to John 446 which says once more he

382
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,430
visited Kanna in Galilee where he had

383
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,589
turned the water into wine and there was

384
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:13,100
a certain royal official whose son lay

385
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:16,880
sick at Capernaum I'm not sure I get the

386
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,580
reference that said maybe every covered

387
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,680
Bible why why are you green screened in

388
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:27,200
Sasha well cuz I I'm on the wine she

389
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,540
lives on the moon folks she lives on the

390
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:34,120
moon why would sash abhi green screened

391
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,120
in when we are all green screened in

392
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:40,400
just saying so for the record for those

393
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,760
of you wondering why sometimes we

394
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,190
accidentally reach out a frame it

395
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,110
happens there we go it's because we have

396
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,340
two different cameras now - for the

397
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,570
record hi Sasha

398
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,680
and when I look at Robbie it doesn't

399
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,030
even look like I'm looking at you

400
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,740
because we have two different cameras I

401
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:01,160
have to look at a chair in order to make

402
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,530
eye contact with Sasha yeah see these

403
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,720
are all the things that for some reason

404
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,790
I think people take for granted when it

405
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,440
comes to making a show is that it's not

406
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,000
always just a single camera there's a

407
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,130
lot more that goes into the show like

408
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
there's absolute Amma's around me right

409
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,030
now mm-hmm

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,520
and light nice the lure and a green

411
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:26,830
screen behind each of us with me mark a

412
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:31,610
the brick as long as a mark a or marker

413
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:34,820
its mark a SATA should we say yeah we'll

414
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:37,880
Varys says I pay for YouTube red so I

415

speak French so I'm assuming that's a

446
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:37,060
French but thank you to all of our

447

when we come back we're gonna be showing

454

you all kinds of exciting stuff first of

455
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,950
all we're gonna be looking at how to

456
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,990
figure out what files are taking up a

457
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,000
boatload of space on our computers going

458
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,520
to help us so that we can hone in on

459
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,720
those space hogs stick around we'll be

welcome back this is category five

470
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:01,809
technology TV tonight we're looking on

471
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:04,419
our computer for space hogs pigs in

472
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:05,860
space I'm pretty sure there was like a

473
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:13,330
Muppets episode or something probably

474
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:15,880
was space hogs are essentially files

475
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,559
that fill up your hard drive so you know

476
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,059
maybe somebody on your computer has

477
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:21,250
downloaded a couple of videos that are

478
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:23,470
all four gigs each and suddenly you're

479
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,960
starting to find that that little 128

480
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,730
gigabyte SSD is running a little low so

481
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,429
tonight we're gonna learn a couple of

482
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,289
tricks well I trick on Linux that's

483
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:36,330
gonna show us how to figure that out on

484
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:38,529
a server okay or through the terminal

485
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,760
why are we skipping right to the

486
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,960
terminal why are we skipping right to

487
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,350
the server well back on episode number

488
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,330
401 we already took a look at a couple

489
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:49,570
of different tools first of all we

490
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:52,149
looked at a program called space sniffer

491
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,309
and that is a Windows tool that allows

492
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:56,409
you to graphically visualize the space

493
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:59,289
usage on your computer brilliant stuff

494
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:02,320
now we showed you on episode 401 how to

495
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:05,380
now use space sniffer in order to find

496
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,120
that same issue on a Linux machine right

497
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,510
using wine which we learned about last

498
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,039
week so we no longer we don't have to

499
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,080
look at the GUI we've already done that

500
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:16,510
look at episode number 401 of category 5

501
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,520
technology TV but what I run into and

502
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,929
what you may run into if you have Linux

503
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,350
servers anywhere throughout your network

504
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:25,210
or online is that hey you know what what

505
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,789
do I do about my server when space

506
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,070
starts getting eaten up where is all the

507
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:32,049
space going so tonight we're gonna look

508
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,480
at a terminal command that's going to

509
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:35,740
allow us to do that so over here on my

510
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,220
computer I'm just gonna bring up putty

511
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,230
and I'm gonna bring up one of my Linux

512
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,809
servers which is going to allow us to

513
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,690
show you one of the ways to do this so

514
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:48,399
putty allows me to log in to my server

515
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,460
from a remote location this is just a

516
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:53,950
terminal emulator that lets me in so I'm

517
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,450
gonna log into our gaming server for

518
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,400
example and I'm going to become a super

519
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,010
user

520
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,110
and here's the thing a server does not

521
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,990
traditionally have a GUI correct and a

522
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,400
GUI being like a desktop environment on

523
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,510
Windows that would be like the thing

524
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,380
with your Start menu gonna get somebody

525
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:15,960
saying you said it wrong it's gooey so

526
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,400
here on a server I'm got this remote

527
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,460
connection and I'm gonna bring up

528
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,820
because I don't have a GUI I can

529
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,690
actually access it from here so

530
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,710
typically there are a couple of

531
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,340
different commands that we're going to

532
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:31,620
use so we can go D F - H which is disk

533
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,130
free and that's going to tell me hey how

534
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,990
many how many megabytes or gigabytes are

535
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:40,800
available on the particular disk that I

536
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:43,830
am looking at or on a list of all the

537
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,870
different disks in this system and there

538
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,090
it is so there's my disk free space so I

539
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:53,310
can see I've got nine percent use on

540
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:56,280
slash that's good so now if I do a D you

541
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:59,460
- H that shows me the disk usage which

542
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,470
cool takes forever it's it's gonna show

543
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,040
me the ultimate disk usage at the end

544
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,740
let's go to home Robbie and try it there

545
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,200
disk usage - H this is traditionally how

546
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:14,220
we do it on a server right so it's going

547
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,290
through all my files and takes a little

548
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,740
bit of time to find everything that's

549
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:21,720
there and at the end of the report it's

550
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,120
going to actually show me a tally of how

551
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,400
much disk usage there is now I can sort

552
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,350
that by the biggest files and I can go

553
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,680
through that kind of hoopla but there is

554
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:34,230
an easier easier way using n curses okay

555
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,210
so this shows me a tally at the end if I

556
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,630
were to allow it to keep going but n

557
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:42,330
curses is basically a interface for the

558
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,520
terminal that allows programs to have a

559
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,220
bit of a GUI a bit of an interface

560
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,460
that's beyond just text-based so the

561
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:54,030
program that we want to use is as an N

562
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:58,560
cursors program that is disk usage for n

563
00:25:54,030 --> 00:26:03,090
curses is in C D U I believe so

564
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:05,760
n CD you try that it says n CD you not

565
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,760
found so let's install it at install n

566
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,520
CD you and hit enter and now it's

567
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,570
grabbed it

568
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,390
so if I type n CDU - - help now I should

569
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:18,070
see oh it doesn't even have a help let's

570
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:22,690
see n CDU oh it starts scanning

571
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:24,640
immediately crazy what I want to show

572
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,950
you how I can use this tool in my

573
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,309
terminal on my server to be really

574
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,530
really quick about it so n CDU and then

575
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:36,250
you can specify slash and it will show

576
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:37,450
you the the usage on slash but I don't

577
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,550
necessarily need to do that I'm just

578
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,260
gonna go home slash Robbie and there's

579
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,120
another thing that I want to do and this

580
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,440
is why when when I run these commands

581
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240
you see that it's running a little bit

582
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,920
slow because I've got a lot of mount

583
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,960
points on this or on this server and

584
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,460
it's acting out to other servers so I

585
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,309
want to say you know what I only care

586
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,929
about the built-in hard drive and the

587
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:58,900
hard drive that I'm actually using right

588
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:01,660
now in the slash home slash Robbie so I

589
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,929
do dash X and what that does is it says

590
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:07,090
only scan the media that is the same as

591
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:09,490
home dat slash Robbie so I'm gonna

592
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,380
ignore any Samba share CIFS and that

593
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,270
kind of stuff hit enter now it scans

594
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,970
everything and almost instantly now I

595
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:17,440
see a report and again and curses allows

596
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,270
me to navigate this with the keyboard

597
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,290
I'm going to just kind of move up here

598
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,610
now that I'm zoomed in you're not

599
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:25,929
getting a full view there we go

600
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:29,050
there so that's what it looks like on my

601
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:31,270
screen I can I can navigate that with my

602
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:34,480
keyboard going up and down so this is a

603
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:36,160
mind test gaming server so obviously

604
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,900
we've got a lot of maps on there so in

605
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,820
my case I can go there and I can see Wow

606
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:43,120
survival servers using six point seven

607
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:45,040
gigs our dome server is only using one

608
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,600
gig and I can navigate that and see

609
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,160
where the file usage is actually

610
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,710
happening see how much faster that is

611
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,679
and easier than using something like D U

612
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,210
it's just like instantaneous so that's a

613
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,950
great tool for you just a quick and

614
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,540
dirty Linux tip for you if you're

615
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,809
running a Linux server anywhere on your

616
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:05,230
network grab ahold think n curses disk

617
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:06,700
usage so NC d u-- is the tool that you

618
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,020
want to install you want to run it as

619
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,600
root so that it doesn't have any sharing

620
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,250
any violations as far as permissions go

621
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,990
you want it to be able to scan all the

622
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:18,160
folders on your computer and then you

623
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:20,320
use n CDU - X we learned about that and

624
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,690
then where you want to check so slash

625
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,559
would be your entire heart

626
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:27,929
drive or slash home slash Robbie as my

627
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,600
home folder and go about it that way

628
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,769
that is n CD you it's available just as

629
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,559
you saw there you can install it on

630
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:37,320
Linux with apt or yum however you want

631
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,240
to install it okay so we're gonna head

632
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,970
over to the news room if you are all

633
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,340
prepared and ready to go I am ready to

634
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,210
rock here are the stories were covering

635
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,590
this week in the category 5 TV newsroom

636
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,120
forget about working overtime in Japan

637
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,240
now the drones are flying overhead

638
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,879
blaring the tune auld lang syne in a

639

restrict where they can go in the city

642

week's top tech stories with a slight

00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:05,789
linux bias i'm sasha Rickman and here

664
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:08,549
are the top stories were following this

665
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:10,110
week since World War two Japan has been

666
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:12,600
struck has been struggling with a world

667
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,389
work culture that consists of excessive

668
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,919
overtime to curb that behavior one firm

669
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:19,080
is planning to use drones that fly

670
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,179
around the office blasting auld lang

671
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,480
syne to get employees to realize it's

672
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:27,389
time to go home the system developed by

673
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,350
office security and cleaning firm tae-se

674
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:33,299
and telecom giant NTT will see drones

675
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,440
patrolling the office on a scheduled

676
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,050
flight path

677
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,520
the drones will also record footage of

678
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,800
what they see during the flight to

679
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,190
identify employees who remain in the

680
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:47,010
office after standard work hours it may

681
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,680
sound a little silly but something must

682
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:51,840
be done a white paper released last year

683
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,000
found that one in five Japanese people

684
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,850
work an average of forty nine hours or

685
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,980
longer each week from those thousands of

686
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,890
workers died each year most of whom are

687
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,360
only in their 30s and 40s the victims

688
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,200
died from various illnesses such as

689
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,470
heart failure

690
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,270
exhaustion stroke starvation or suicide

691
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:12,540
as a result of work stress and

692
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:14,640
depression of the drones the director of

693
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,740
the program says you can't really work

694
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,560
when you think it's coming over any time

695
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,140
now so what is auld lang syne anyway

696
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,180
it's a tune that typically plays in

697
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,030
Japanese malls to announce that the

698
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:30,450
stores are closing tie say will trial

699
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:32,400
the system in April 2018 dargah ting a

700
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,110
monthly fee that works out to about four

701
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:39,510
hundred and fifty dollars for companies

702
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:45,900
to use this service this is an

703
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:47,730
interesting tactic that is flying around

704
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,520
with a giant speaker I'm more concerned

705
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm not so concerned about telling

706
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,170
people that it's time to go home as what

707
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,940
is your workload like what's making you

708
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,340
this workaholic if you will what's

709
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,820
making you stay such long hours well a

710
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:06,180
lot of it is cultural to it to a certain

711
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,400
extent of of just that productivity that

712
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,530
performance that or that honor aspect of

713
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,110
you know I'm a hard worker I've got a

714
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:16,410
few friends from Japan and that's one of

715
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,760
the things that they do struggle with is

716
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,640
you know I don't want to be the first

717
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,960
one out the door I you know I want to

718
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,490
show that I'm committed to the company

719
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,740
how much of that is it falls on the

720
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,200
employers shoulders though like if you

721
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:31,200
have an employer who's pushing you to

722
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,330
meet quotas and and giving incentives

723
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,490
that are unreasonable in order to make

724
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,930
those incentives well obviously these

725
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,030
employers aren't thinking that if

726
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,070
they're willing to buy a drone sure yeah

727
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,470
fly around playing the song that only

728
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,300
plays here once a year yeah but here's

729
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,010
what I find interesting about it instead

730
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,780
of somebody walking around saying hey

731
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:51,450
listen thank you for your work

732
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,610
get out of here it's a drone like how

733
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,950
impersonal is that how big is this

734
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,960
factory that they need a drone I'd like

735
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,520
to know if it's a teenager obviously

736
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,780
they're not going to listen to the drone

737
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,740
like that's just the way it's gonna go

738
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,620
so what are they gonna do they're gonna

739
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,090
buy like like Jimmy's head phones and

740
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,920
they're just gonna pop them in your ear

741
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,930
so you hear you don't hear it

742
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,100
else Yeah right what I find interesting

743
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,710
is the fact that it's also going to

744
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,470
record what it sees so are they gonna

745
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:21,450
like is this oh we caught you on camera

746
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:23,130
not leaving you're suspended I feel the

747
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,870
Foo is saying well these are salaried

748
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,160
workers but then it brings me back to

749
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,380
well what if you're trying to meet

750
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:32,120
quotas in order to right get incentives

751
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:36,740
like a bonus or something like that

752
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,740
different like the Macarena or something

753
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:47,340
crazy all right in a blow to the growing

754
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:49,050
robot delivery industry San Francisco

755
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,930
officials have voted to restrict where

756
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,490
their robots can actually go in the city

757
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,710
startups will have to get permits to use

758
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:59,070
such BOTS which will be restricted to

759
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:00,240
less crowded urban areas opponents are

760
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,790
concerned about the safety of

761
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,970
pedestrians particularly elderly people

762
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,639
and children walk San Francisco a group

763
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:11,610
that campaigned for pedestrian safety

764
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:13,740
wanted a complete ban a range of

765
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,960
companies have begun trialing small

766
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,780
robots that can deliver food and other

767
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,580
goods they use sensors and lasers in a

768
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,070
similar way to self-driving cars in

769
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,110
order to navigate their routes robotics

770
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,169
company Marvel which describes its

771
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:29,940
machines as friendly neighborhood robots

772
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:30,720
began testing in San Francisco earlier

773
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,419
this year

774
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,159
other companies such as Starship and

775
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:37,950
post mates are also keen to use

776
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,780
sidewalks for robot deliveries San

777
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,700
Francisco supervisor Norman me who

778
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,460
originally proposed the ban on such

779
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:47,220
robots has previously said that the city

780
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,409
streets are for people not robots

781
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,139
despite its proximity to Silicon Valley

782
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,330
San Francisco is falling behind other

783
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,399
states such as Virginia and Idaho where

784
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,190
there are already laws permitting

785
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:07,500
delivery robots to operate

786
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:10,650
so yeah come on I just feel like well

787
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,240
okay so there's sidewalks obviously are

788
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,750
going to be used for pedestrians but how

789
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,710
many pedestrians are there it's not like

790
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,650
pedestrians I feel like they're in the

791
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,210
minority anyway most people drive cars

792
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:24,660
even still we're talking about a robot a

793
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:27,990
robot that is basically benign and stays

794
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:30,630
clear of humans and drives at six miles

795
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:32,070
an hour well I have to wonder like we're

796
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,870
talking sidewalks I don't know about

797
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,810
anybody else but I have yet to find a

798
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:39,150
sidewalk that doesn't have bumps and

799
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:45,540
cracks and lead like ledges that you

800
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:47,790
could trip on and like like if a robot

801
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,230
comes into an obstacle where maybe they

802
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,060
can't get over it how does this oh

803
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,280
they'll get over it no problem yeah I

804
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,720
mean like the six wheeled machines that

805
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,130
they have right now they're like the

806
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,570
size of a cooler and they've got six

807
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,210
wheels and they just kind of crawl up

808
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:03,000
over like a Land Rover oh no problem at

809
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,090
all I get up the curb nothing right so

810
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,620
my question is if they already have

811
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,060
these robots doing deliveries in the

812
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,070
other states have there been incidents

813
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,870
where there's been concern there's been

814
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,970
no nothing that I've heard of anyways no

815
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,560
I haven't okay and even if there was

816
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,640
like you know they keep bump into

817
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,950
someone on the street and you know

818
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:24,060
excuse me sorry right at least here in

819
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:25,530
Canada these delivery robots I want to

820
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,910
know like do they deliver just like is

821
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:30,120
it the mail cuz there was one that was

822
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:34,920
post bots or something and there was the

823
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:37,050
groceries so surely oh you think about

824
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,310
an elderly person so take take it you

825
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,510
know okay well we're worried about the

826
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,930
elderly folks that are walking down the

827
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,550
sidewalk

828
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,620
all right put flip it over and say what

829
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,730
about the elderly person who can't go

830
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,620
out to get their medicine or their

831
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,090
groceries and now it can be delivered by

832
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,800
one of these robots that they just open

833
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,050
the door and open it up and that's thing

834
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,710
I have an idea I have a solution I've

835
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,420
got this

836
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,220
are you listening San Francisco this is

837
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,530
gonna work okay so you know how in there

838
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,070
on the roads you have like a car lane

839
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:04,140
and you have a bike lane a bike lane the

840
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,540
sidewalks have a little robot Lane I

841
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,640
think it's perfect I think we're still

842
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,960
trying to get into the whole bike lane

843
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,180
thing not everybody's a fan of that

844
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,550
the likelihood of them jumping onboard a

845
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,140
robot lame before bike lane but again

846
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:19,809
these robots travel at about the same

847
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,099
speed as a human pedestrian see what's

848
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:22,809
interesting about this though is we're

849
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:24,849
talking about robots that are on the

850
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,559
ground everybody's talking about drone

851
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:28,089
technology wouldn't it just solve the

852
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,470
problem to have drones doing what this

853
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:31,569
can this can handle something there's a

854
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:39,030
lot heavier that's delivering like

855
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:41,170
pizzas and and pedestrians

856
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,880
one of the fears too is that they're

857
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,890
worried that what if they get vandalized

858
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,140
by you know because they do only travel

859
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,640
like at a snail's pace so you know what

860
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,530
what if they do get vandalized or

861
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,420
someone breaks into them and that kind

862
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:57,099
of stuff it's a it's another concern or

863
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:59,020
underground tunnels idea yeah I don't

864
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:00,130
know about the topography of San

865
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,990
Francisco but if you could do

866
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:07,059
underground tunnels then have you seen

867
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:09,430
some of those people don't want to be

868
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:12,010
walking up that there he'll bring it on

869
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:13,510
robot bring it to me yeah I just don't

870
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:15,549
feel like there's probably a lot of

871
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:17,770
pedestrians out and about I don't know I

872
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:22,650
don't see a lot of them I am backslash

873
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,650
of facts cuz I cite your statements

874
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:26,260
who's watching this on their phone while

875
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:32,859
they're walking down San Francisco

876
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:36,280
sidewalks what no me comment on YouTube

877
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:39,160
I want one of these robots to deliver

878
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,510
things to me even if I were to go to the

879
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,339
grocery store cause it's heavy carrying

880
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:46,210
things back again I've said that I'm I

881
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:48,609
am pedestrian I'm not a robot I would

882
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:51,160
like to be able to just have a companion

883
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:53,140
robot bring my things home with me I

884
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,799
would like yeah it's about the size of

885
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,960
like a baby carriage and about like they

886
00:38:56,799 --> 00:39:01,390
call it Ottoman height so think about an

887
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,920
ottoman how high they are pretty short

888
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,260
like knee height I kind of think they're

889
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,420
perfect not gonna lie there you go what

890
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,960
do you think you comment below what it's

891
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:14,710
not okay we know how I feel all right

892
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,020

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,960
of himself playing Minecraft and Pokemon

youtuber whose real name is Dan

Middleton did not feature in the top 10

905
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,940
list last year dantdm 'he's recent life

906
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:52,099
who were included a show at the sydney

907
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,930
opera house which became the second

908
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:56,839
fastest selling show in the venue's

909
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,730
history he started posting videos which

910
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:01,430
were aimed at viewers under 10 years old

911
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:05,060
at the time he was also working at a

912
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:07,070
grocery store dude perfect also made the

913
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,980
list with about 14 million dollars in

914

916
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:20,089
ryan earned more than 11 million dollars

917
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,339
reviewing toys on his channel ryan

918
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:24,920
toysreview

919
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:26,869
back in november dantdm said that he

920
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,480
wasn't prepared for the fame he got from

921
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:31,369
being a youtuber he said it is intense

922
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,470
being a role model for young people and

923
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:39,589
it's something he is still learning so

924
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:43,820
the most shocking for me is probably the

925
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:47,119
fact that he does live shows on stage

926
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:48,920
how how do you do that a lot of fun for

927
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,400
kids because I mean the kids are

928
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,930
watching the shows on YouTube it's like

929
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,260
like when we used to watch Sharon Louis

930
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:59,119
and Bram or you know mr. dressup or

931
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:01,280
right you know any of these show so I

932
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,460
went and saw Ernie Coombs in in theater

933
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,080
and he did magic stuff and he did the

934
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,880
dress-up thing and he'd you know

935
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,490
everything else that you did it was just

936
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,440
fun stuff to entertain children so

937
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:15,109
dantdm and other youtubers that are

938
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,470
focused on the the child audience dantdm

939
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:19,910
in particular is doing exactly that he's

940
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,589
pulling out his guitar and strumming

941
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,990
along and making the kids sing along to

942
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:25,400
a video that playing behind them and you

943
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,410
know doing all kinds of things doing

944
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,060
magic tricks doing games that are

945
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:32,300
interactive with the audience right

946
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,010
because your daughter ended up with a

947
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,490
contest or a contest of some sort with a

948
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,610
sketchy

949
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:40,250
with him does she not she was on dantdm

950
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:43,550
show yeah yeah yeah yeah she's the host

951
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:46,430
of the pixel shadow if you go to mind

952
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:49,100
test dot TV you'll see that but yeah she

953
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:52,190
was featured on on his show like all of

954
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,780
these these people on YouTube that are

955
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:57,170
doing these shows and making all of

956
00:41:53,780 --> 00:42:00,110
these you know crazy dollars Ryan it's

957
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:02,270
nuts six years old six

958
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:07,070
it's insane he's just living the dream

959
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:10,460
well it's funny I mean as much as I find

960
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:13,160
this absolutely incredible I also look

961
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,990
at it and go they're just doing a video

962
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,060
and they're getting paid this insane

963
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:20,000
amount of money like this six-year-old

964
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,410
kid who does the reviews you just open

965
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,270
it up a box and getting excited about a

966
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,980
toy or whatever it is yeah it's it's

967
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,780
it's fair instead of raking in the cash

968
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,770
because even though it's his YouTube

969
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,160
channel he doesn't have the legal

970
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:32,090
authority Texas realistically it's it's

971
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,460
a team effort

972
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:37,910
right absolutely yeah for sure but it's

973
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,859
just I I find it so fascinating that's

974
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:42,460
something like just one person's video

975
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:46,760
can catch on and it just goes nuts

976
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:48,109
we actually have band dantdm during the

977
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,910
day in our house because our son is

978
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:51,530
almost old and oh yeah

979
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,150
we have found that there are times where

980
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,310
it's okay you're gonna do your math and

981
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:57,560
we're gonna go take care of this and we

982
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:59,630
come back and oh look he spent 40

983
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,900
minutes doing dantdm yes instead of

984
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:05,510
doing his online math it's like okay

985
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:08,600
fine we have his feed block during the

986
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,460
day the foo again in the chatroom below

987
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,840
is commenting about how you have to be

988
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,210
13 years or older to have a youtube

989
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,369
channel correct but keep in mind like my

990
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:19,220
daughter we started her channel when she

991
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:20,570
was 9 or 10 but it's me it's dad that's

992
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,550
setting it all up and creating the

993
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,830
account and making sure that the the

994
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,850
nasty YouTube comments are deleted

995
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,130
before she sees them in those

996
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,990
conversations to the best of my ability

997
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,340
and same with Ryan is it's gonna be as

998
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,810
folks that are really you know they're

999
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,910
the ones who are buying all the toys and

1000
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:38,000
making them review it but here's the

1001
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:40,070
thing he's this he's a clever kid yeah

1002
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,820
and that's it that's what it boils down

1003
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:45,680
to dantdm is a clever kid he's come up

1004
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,240
with something that's unique and he's

1005
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,000
doing a great job of it and he's found

1006
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,390
in

1007
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,990
and he's kept it up the same he's just

1008
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:57,360
is a funny kid who just he was exuberant

1009
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,040
and and outgoing and and that's what

1010
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,510
makes him popular I would also like to

1011
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,690
point out that this all happened in one

1012
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:05,730
year which means 2017 okay so Ryan's a

1013
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:07,250
six year old kid who opens boxes of

1014
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:11,970
things and gets super excited about it

1015
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:13,620
Robby you are a grown kid who opens

1016
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,990
boxes of things and gets excited about

1017
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:19,170
them open more boxes that's right

1018
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:21,060
this is the way it's gonna go that's how

1019
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,010
that's how we get rich we open boxes

1020
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:26,750
that's right 20 18s list

1021
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:29,880
[Laughter]

1022
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:31,830
TeamViewer has issued an urgent patch to

1023
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,690
fix a vulnerability that allows users

1024
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:36,110
sharing a desktop session to gain

1025
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:39,060
control of another PC without permission

1026
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:41,850
this vulnerability affected versions of

1027
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:45,210
TeamViewer running on Windows Mac OS and

1028
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:48,780
Linux machines TeamViewer is a popular

1029
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:51,570
remote support software for desktop

1030
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:54,390
sharing online meetings web conferencing

1031
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:56,310
and file transfers between computers

1032
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,830
over the internet from anywhere in the

1033
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:00,870
world to establish a connection between

1034
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:03,240
a local computer and a remote computer

1035
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:05,730
the local computer requires the remote

1036
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,910
computers ID and password to gain

1037
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:11,010
control over the remote computer a

1038
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:11,820
critical vulnerability was publicized by

1039
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,440
a Reddit user

1040
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,510
last week linking it to a

1041
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,900
proof-of-concept that was published on

1042
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:20,640
github by a user named Gellin TeamViewer

1043
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,560
acknowledged the existence of the

1044
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,830
vulnerability after it was publicly

1045
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,080
disclosed the proof-of-concept showed

1046
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:30,960
how a user could modify TeamViewer

1047
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,750
permissions with a simple DLL which

1048
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,000
controls naked inline hooking and direct

1049
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:39,030
memory modification to change TeamViewer

1050
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,880
permissions the code can be used on both

1051
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,770
the client and the server side allowing

1052
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,750
the malicious user to gain control of

1053
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:49,590
the presenters session or the viewer

1054
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:52,140
session without permission those users

1055
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,330
who have configured TeamViewer to accept

1056
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,520
automatic updates will get the patch

1057
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:58,260
delivered automatically however it could

1058
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,290
take up to three to seven days for the

1059
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,330
patches before the update is installed

1060
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:05,910
those who do not have automatic updates

1061
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:08,220
that will be notified when an update is

1062
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:10,020
available mmm

1063
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:14,070
danger so for anybody who's listening

1064
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:17,670
going what's a dll hmm Robbie what's the

1065
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:21,000
deal oh just like dynamic link library

1066
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:23,100
did you say it wrong what I don't think

1067
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,840
so

1068
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:29,010
here's so Windows in order to reduce

1069
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,870
resource usage to make things load

1070
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,880
faster uses what's called a dynamic link

1071
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:35,070
library they are files that are shared

1072
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,080
among other applications so these files

1073
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:39,480
can be opened by that application for

1074
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,700
certain functionality within Windows so

1075
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:46,590
if one of those dll's contains a hook

1076
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:48,300
then it can be used to exploit any kind

1077
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:51,240
of you know whatever the program or the

1078
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,580
hacker wants to put in there okay now

1079
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,750
what about naked in line hooking because

1080
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:58,860
that sounds like something you'd see on

1081
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:01,460
a roller derby in line hooking is like

1082
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:06,030
when a when a program in this case

1083
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:06,810
malicious program hooks into one of

1084
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,600
those dll's

1085
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:11,400
and overrides some of the bytes of the

1086
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,420
code so that it will now load something

1087
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:18,180
else okay so in a function so if let's

1088
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,860
say to keep it really simple you know

1089
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,720
when I click the file button it pops up

1090
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:24,450
the file menu well that's a function so

1091
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:27,240
if I can hook into that DLL that opens

1092
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:29,550
that file menu and make it also execute

1093
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,020
a malicious program in the background

1094
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,670
then all of a sudden I've got something

1095
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,800
happening that is not intended by the

1096
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,690
right software developer that's kind of

1097
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,820
what's happened here they've been able

1098
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:41,940
to create a hook that hooks into one of

1099
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:43,950
the DLLs that allows reverse access

1100
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,990
without permission right you're writing

1101
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:47,940
the permissions is it always super

1102
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:50,070
obvious if you have TeamViewer like

1103
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,590
could somebody install TeamViewer on

1104
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:55,430
your computer without you realizing it

1105
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:58,440
TeamViewer is a great application for

1106
00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:00,420
remote support a lot of technicians use

1107
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,860
it sometimes like if I'm helping you out

1108
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,550
sometimes I'll use TeamViewer to remote

1109
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:07,410
in and connect and help you out but you

1110
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:10,680
know who commonly uses it are those

1111
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:12,630
folks the fake support callers these the

1112
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,099
folks that call you up and say you know

1113
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:16,630
hi this is Microsoft calling and we're

1114
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:18,700
here to help and we've we're gonna

1115
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:20,529
remote into your computer and fix this

1116
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,150
virus that's going around and Pat your

1117
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:25,059
computer and some people fall for that

1118
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,499
you may not but some people do Microsoft

1119
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:28,450
doesn't call neither does your bank

1120
00:48:26,499 --> 00:48:30,549
neither does you know they they don't

1121
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:33,519
ask for access to your computers ever a

1122
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:35,470
red flag so when they do that they need

1123
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,329
a tool in order to do it and sometimes

1124
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,769
what they'll do is they'll maybe use

1125
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:40,150
something else and then in the

1126
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:41,259
background while you while they're

1127
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,720
connected install something like

1128
00:48:41,259 --> 00:48:45,549
TeamViewer or something else that but

1129
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,499
that's not related to this DLL issue

1130
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:49,630
this is you know something that you just

1131
00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:50,229
need to watch out for is hey this is

1132
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,029
being smart

1133
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:54,999
it gives remote access to your computer

1134
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:58,299
from you know someone else right yeah

1135
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:59,380
and now that it's public right so a lot

1136
00:48:58,299 --> 00:49:01,599
of times when there's a problem like

1137
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,339
this it stays kind of in the background

1138
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,160
for so long but now everyone knows that

1139
00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:08,829
it's there so make sure that you up like

1140
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,799
you update and that happens you know

1141
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:14,799
actually are applied and this affects

1142
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:16,509
all the platforms of TeamViewer as far

1143
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:18,549
as I know like this Oh Linux users are

1144
00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:20,829
as susceptible as a Windows user in this

1145
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:22,479
particular instance so and it's a great

1146
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:24,369
tool but sometimes these kinds of things

1147
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:25,509
can happen and they're quick to update

1148
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:29,559
it but you need to update your software

1149
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:32,890
in order to get that fix exactly thanks

1150

00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:33,109
back this is category five technology TV

1195
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:36,230
now if you are one of our supporters on

1196
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:37,640
patreon a patron then you probably

1197
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,900
already know the information that I'm

1198
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,090
about to share but I want to share it

1199
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,470
with you just so that everyone's aware

1200
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:45,170
now we've had a lot of different changes

1201
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:47,270
on our patreon page over the past couple

1202
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:50,119
of weeks one of those is that our

1203
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:52,100
patronage is now monthly so if you're a

1204
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:54,350
supporter you need to really quickly get

1205
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,750
in there and change your pledge because

1206
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:59,060
for example if you used to give a dollar

1207
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:01,670
a month or it pardon me a dollar a week

1208
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:04,040
now it's a dollar a month right so what

1209
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:07,310
used to be a $5 per month contribution

1210
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,619
it is now only a $1 a month contribution

1211
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:11,060
so there are very good reasons for why

1212
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:12,980
this change has taken place it's going

1213
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:15,560
to really help us to be able to provide

1214
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:17,420
some great exclusive content to our

1215
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,460
patrons I'm very very excited about this

1216
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:22,040
we've got our vlog we've got seven

1217
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,230
episodes up already more episodes coming

1218
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:26,030
and that's happening on a regular basis

1219
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:27,770
but only our patrons have access to that

1220
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:30,320
and there's some other stuff there for

1221
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:32,690
patrons as well head on over to cat5 dot

1222
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,250
TV slash patreon and you're gonna find

1223
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:36,770
out all about that

1224
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:39,109
one of the things that has happened over

1225
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,369
the past couple of weeks as patreon sent

1226
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:42,619
out an announcement saying that they're

1227
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:45,349
making some changes to the fees yes that

1228
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:47,750
stirred it up and I even heard big-time

1229
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:49,609
a couple of our viewers and our patrons

1230
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,770
bill reached out to me and said what are

1231
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:53,829
your thoughts on this and I said at the

1232
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:58,099
time you know what it's all about

1233
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:59,960
building our community and if patreon

1234
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:01,910
makes changes to their fee structure I

1235
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,730
hope that our patrons will understand

1236
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:07,460
that and know that the funds are still

1237
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:09,410
helping us out out a great deal and you

1238
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,480
know it is building a community right

1239
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:15,650
kind of a community within our community

1240
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:18,740
of patrons now today just a few moments

1241
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:20,319
ago an email went out from patreon so if

1242
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,780
you haven't seen this you need to know

1243
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:25,970
patreon has in fact apologized for their

1244
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,520
announcement about making these fee

1245
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:31,069
changes yes they have reversed it and

1246
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:33,049
they've said we are not going forth with

1247
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:34,670
those feet changes we're going to look

1248
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:36,020
at this take a different approach we're

1249
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,270
gonna figure out how we can make this

1250
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:40,520
work but we are not going to do what we

1251
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:42,380
announced a week ago so keep in mind if

1252
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,599
you were a little put off by patreon

1253
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,880
announcement about the fee changes it

1254
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:50,359
has been reversed and it will not be

1255
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,180
going forward our patrons have access to

1256
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:55,520

00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:49,019
able to watch live I agree that the

1297
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:51,329
Orval is fantastic when I saw the

1298
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:53,009
previews prior to the series launch and

1299
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:54,869
looked interesting but now that it's

1300
00:55:53,009 --> 00:55:57,420
available on Hulu I've been watching it

1301

00:56:11,609 --> 00:56:15,240
from Malcolm Malcolm says really

1309
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,579
enjoying the show since I discovered it

1310
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,369
a few months ago we knew something oh

1311
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:23,490
who knew something like this existed

1312
00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:25,589
from Ontario I actually stumbled upon it

1313
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:29,539
when doing a Google search to use

1314
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:33,089
handbrake this is DVD ripping software I

1315
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:34,710
needed to get a section of a DVD into

1316
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:36,450
Pro presenter for our churches family

1317
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:39,059
night and until then I had never even

1318
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:43,380
heard of category 5 who know that this

1319
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:45,420
has been going on for over 10 years this

1320
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,160
past week I tried the online version of

1321
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:50,579
a phonic we showed that a couple of

1322
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,349
weeks ago and wow what a difference this

1323
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:54,750
is made to the recording of our pastors

1324
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:56,970
sermons it seems like you're always

1325
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:58,710
covering some kind of day-to-day content

1326
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:00,780
of which you have experienced yourself

1327
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,760
and that just makes it so much

1328
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,550
personal and applicable keep up the

1329
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,140
great work category-five team that came

1330
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,120
to us from malcolm thank you very much

1331
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,830

1332
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,560
is a true fan thank you sir

1333
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:15,570
indeed I like that it's hey who knew

1334
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,340
something like this from Ontario existed

1335
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:19,590
and and it's true because you've got

1336
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:22,620
some great shows out though from other

1337
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:24,120
areas of the world where you typically

1338
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:26,280
would expect this kind of stuff to come

1339
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:29,570
out but you know for some reason people

1340
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:32,400
just don't expect little Ontario

1341
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:33,990
podcasts out of Hollywood I did have one

1342
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,100
run out run-in with some buddies like

1343
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:41,610

1344
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:41,610
[Laughter]

1345
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:49,470

1348
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:56,310

1349
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,680

1350

had it happen at KFC that was the best I

1351
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,190
went to the KFC drive-thru and they

1352
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:04,200

1353
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:07,800

benefits free chicken you could get free
