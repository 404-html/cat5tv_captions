Our very own Robbie Ferguson has written a piece of software that uses speech-to-text and machine learning to convert all Category5 TV Network shows to WebVTT Subtitles, and then translates them into a number of languages and pushes them to GitHub. This process is 100% automated and as such has less-than-perfect accuracy (though is quite usable).

This is your chance to help hearing impaired individuals enjoy Category5 TV Network shows!

If you would like to contribute, all you need to do is make your corrections to the existing VTT files and create a Pull Request.

Thanks for participating! Let's make Category5 TV more accessible to all!
